        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate two series of Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) in Dharamsala Tibetan: one series uses the numeral ‘one’ with an <em>even</em> particle, with an optional nominal domain. The other series combines a <em>wh</em>-word with the same <em>even</em> particle, and may appear with or without the numeral ‘one.’ We discuss the relation of these NPIs to indefinite expressions in Dharamsala Tibetan, and document their syntactic licensing conditions. We show that NPIs are licensed in the scope of a clause-mate negation and in questions, but not in other downward-entailing environments. \n\nWe then present a compositional semantics for these two types of NPIs which explains their negative-polarity dependency, based on Lahiri’s (1998) analysis of similar constructions in Hindi. Our analysis for <em>wh</em>-<em>even</em> NPIs takes advantage of the Hamblin (1973) denotation of <em>wh</em>-words as sets of alternatives and the fact that <em>even</em> introduces two presuppositions&mdash;an additive one and a scalar one. Allowing the additive component of <em>even</em> to scope independently of the scalar part, the additive part of <em>even</em> is used to generate an indefinite out of the <em>wh</em>-word. The scalar component will be used to ensure that <em>even</em>-NPIs can only be used in downward entailing contexts.",

Cross-linguistically, <em>wh</em>-words are commonly used not only for question-formation but also in a range of other constructions, including in quantification and in the formation of relative clauses. We will show that Chuj can use <em>wh</em>-words to form indefinites in certain limited environments, and that it can additionally use <em>wh</em>-words to form free choice items and a universal quantifier. In addition, Chuj uses <em>wh</em>-words to form free relatives, including definite free relatives but also typologically rare indefinite free relatives. We describe the licensing environments and structural size of these two types of free relatives and show that, despite surface similarities, they are two distinct constructions.",

We support this analysis through novel data on the behavior of non-restrictive relative clauses with respect to focus intervention effects in pied-piping (Cable, 2010; Erlewine and Kotek, 2014; Kotek and Erlewine, to appear): only in-situ modes of interpretation (not variable binding or movement) are sensitive to intervention effects (Beck, 2006, a.o.), and RPPP in non-restrictive relative clauses indeed shows intervention effects.

        "year": "to appear",
        "abstract": "English is one of many languages in which relative clauses (RC) can be constructed using <em>wh</em>-words as <em>relative pronouns</em>. The relative pronoun originates lower in the clause and A-moves to the edge of the RC. This movement can <em>pied-pipe</em> other material with it, resulting in <em>relative pronoun pied-piping</em> (RPPP).\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure and interpretation of English <em>non-restrictive relative clauses</em>. We propose that in non-restrictive relatives, relative pronouns are interpreted <em>in-situ</em> within the pied-piped constituent at LF, using Rooth- Hamblin alternative computation (Hamblin, 1973; Rooth, 1985, 1992, a.o.). Evidence comes from the presence of <em>intervention effects</em> in RPPP; intervention effects (Beck, 2006; Sauerland & Heck, 2003, a.o.) can be used to diagnose regions of alternative computation (see Kotek & Erlewine, to appear; Erlewine & Kotek, 2014). The proposal here has the consequence that non-restrictive relatives are fundamentally <em>proposition-denoting</em> in contrast to restrictive relatives which are <em>property-denoting</em>.",

        "abstract": "In this paper I discuss the distribution of focus-sensitive adverbs in Vietnamese, which exhibits a Minimality effect. Given a fixed position for focus β, there may be different structural heights within a given phase where an adverb α associating with that focus β can adjoin. The focus-sensitive adverb α must appear in the position which minimizes the structural distance between it and its focus associate β. This translates into a requirement that focus-sensitive adverbs adjoin as low as possible, within a particular set of possible adjunction positions.\n\nMuch previous literature on Minimality has focused on whether or not such effects derive from transderivational competition, based primarily on Minimality effects on movement. I show that previous approaches to well-studied Minimality patterns which avoid transderivational competition do not extend to the pattern observed here. In contrast, we can develop a uniform treatment of Minimality effects if we adopt transderivational competition as in early Minimalist work such as Chomsky (1992).",

Previous work on these sentence-final particles (SFPs) has assumed that all SFPs are very high, in the CP periphery. In this paper I show that a subset of SFPs are actually in a lower, clause-medial position, based on the scopal interaction of these SFPs with negation, modals, quantificational subjects, and alternative question disjunction. I identify this position as coinciding with the lower (<em>v</em>P) phase edge.\n\nAs SFPs are head-final heads with head-initial complements, they have been discussed as an important apparent exception to the Final-over-Final Constraint (FOFC), a proposed universal on structure building and linearization. The existence of exceptions to FOFC at the <em>v</em>P edge in addition to the CP edge teaches us that, in its most general form, FOFC does not hold across phase boundaries.",

We support this analysis through novel data on the behavior of non-restrictive relative clauses with respect to focus intervention effects in pied-piping (Cable, 2010; Erlewine and Kotek, 2014; Kotek and Erlewine, to appear): only in-situ modes of interpretation (not variable binding or movement) are sensitive to intervention effects (Beck, 2006, a.o.), and RPPP in non-restrictive relative clauses indeed shows intervention effects. We propose an analysis which utilizes contextual domain restriction on the interpretation of the in-situ wh relative pronoun.",

        "abstract": "In this paper I show that focus-sensitive adverbs in Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese are required to be as low as possible in their phase while c-commanding their focus associate. This generalization parallels what has been proposed under one approach to German focus-sensitive particles by Jacobs (1983, 1986) and Büring and Hartmann (2001) under the banner of &#8220;Closeness,&#8221; but these analyses have been controversial. This &#8216;&#8216;as low as possible&#8221; behavior must result from the comparison of competing derivations, which I model using Optimality Theory. The fact that this requirement only holds within each phase shows that transderivational competition must be evaluated cyclically at each phase (Heck and Müller, 2001; Fanselow and Ćavar, 2001), and more generally offers a new kind of evidence for the idea of phase-based cyclic Spell Out (Chomsky, 2000, 2001).\n\nIn Vietnamese, I study the &#8216;only&#8217; operator <em>chỉ</em>. Vietnamese has a morphologically rich inventory of focus-sensitive operators which makes it clear that <em>chỉ</em> is an adverb. In Mandarin Chinese, I study the focus marker <em>shì</em> and the &#8216;only&#8217; operator <em>zhǐyǒu/zhǐ</em>. I argue that in the synchronic grammar of Mandarin, despite surface appearances, <em>zhǐyǒu</em> is an allomorph of <em>zhǐ</em> and that both <em>shì</em> and <em>zhǐyǒu/zhǐ</em> are adverbs.",

Evidence for the proposal comes from the semantic scope of sentence-final <em>éryǐ</em> and <em>le</em> with respect to negation and modals. Consequences for the syntax of Chinese SFPs and for the Final-over-Final Constraint (FOFC) are discussed.",

However, I show that this c-command requirement is insufficient to capture the distribution of focus adverbs (e.g. <em>only</em>) in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese. I show that focus adverbs must be as low as possible while c-commanding their focus associate, within a particular extended vP domain. The generalization is similar to what has been described for German by Büring and Hartmann (2001), but without an explanation. I propose a syntax for focus adverbs which, together with the standard Roothian semantics of focus, derives this behavior.",

        "abstract": "In an Austronesian-type voice system, a single argument is designated the \"pivot\" in each clause, with verbal morphology indicating the choice of pivot and corresponding changes in case marking and extraction possibilities. It has been suggested that ergativity plays a crucial role in Austronesian-type voice systems. In this paper, we argue that voice marking and case reflect separate but interacting systems, which can be dissociated from each other, based on the behavior of voice in Dinka (Nilotic; South Sudan) and Balinese (Austronesian; Indonesia). These languages exhibit familiar voice morphology, but can clearly be shown to not involve any ergativity. Instead, we propose that what unifies &#8220;voice&#8221; system behavior is a lack of structural licensing for the subject in Non-Subject Voices. We show that different voice systems solve this problem in different ways: Balinese licenses the subject under adjacency with the verb, whereas Dinka allows for last resort assignment of genitive case like in many Austronesian languages of the Philippines and of Taiwan.\n\nInvited contribution.",

        "abstract": "One of the major questions in Austronesian syntax concerns the relationship between voice marking, extraction, and case. Two common approaches have dominated previous literature. Either voice morphology marks extraction and case, or voice morphology feeds extraction and case. These positions are difficult to distinguish, because of the prominent one-to-one correspondence of voice, case, and extraction. In this paper, we bring new insights to this debate, with original data from Balinese and Dinka, a Nilotic language of South Sudan, which we show exhibits a familiar Austronesian-type voice system. We observe environments in these languages where the correspondence between voice and case and voice and extraction breaks down, in a manner that we argue provides evidence that <em>voice marks extraction</em>. Unlike in other extraction-marking languages, however, voice also affects case in Austronesian-type voice systems. We suggest that this is because extraction targets a case position. We account for the changes in case marking in the clause by suggesting that, when the external argument is not extracted, languages must employ alternative strategies to license it.",

I propose that <em>qu</em> is a marker on topics licensed in a particular structural position (Spec,TopicP).

Here I argue that such backwards association is illusory. In cases of apparent leftward subject association, <em>even</em> is associating with the subject&#8217;s predicate-internal lower copy of movement, which is within the scope of <em>even</em>. The same configuration with <em>only</em> yields an uninterpretable structure, due to independent differences in the semantic contribution of <em>even</em> and <em>only</em>. I then show that this pattern of association extends to other cases of movement as well: in general, <em>even</em> but not <em>only</em> is able to associate with material which has moved out of the operator&#8217;s scope. Patterns of leftward focus association present a new argument against the scope theory of <em>even</em>.",

Previous researchers have assumed an exceptionless correlation between AF and the A-bar extraction of a transitive subject. In this paper new data from Kaqchikel (Mayan, Guatemala) shows that AF is a response to A-bar movement of a transitive subject that is too short. Movement of a transitive subject does not trigger AF if the movement chain is made longer by adding intervening material. An anti-locality constraint is proposed: \"Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality,\" which bans movement between successive specifier positions. Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality explains the full distributional pattern of AF in Kaqchikel. ",

        "abstract": "This dissertation investigates the consequences of overt and covert movement on association with focus. The interpretation of focus-sensitive operators such as &#8217;only&#8217; and &#8217;even&#8217; depends on the presence of a focused constituent in their scope. I document the complex conditions under which operators are able to associate with a focused constituent which has moved out of their scope. In particular, I concentrate on the ability of English &#8217;even&#8217; but not &#8217;only&#8217; to associate \"backwards\" in this configuration.\n\nI propose a theory based on the Copy Theory of movement which predicts the attested patterns of backwards association. When an operator gives the appearance of associating backwards, it is in fact associating with focus in the lower copy of the movement chain, within its scope. This is possible with &#8217;even&#8217; but not &#8217;only&#8217; due to independent differences in their compositional semantics: &#8217;only&#8217; uses focus alternatives to compute new truth conditions, whereas &#8217;even&#8217; uses the alternatives to introduce a presupposition without modifying the truth conditions. I furthermore argue that neither syntactic reconstruction nor covert movement of &#8217;even&#8217; (the scope theory) are adequate as a general solution to the problem of backwards association. This analysis supports a view where focus is represented in the narrow syntax and then interpreted at the interfaces.\n\nThe analysis is built upon a general framework for focus interpretation based on Kratzer (1991) which I apply to structures involving copy chains, combined with new facts regarding the projection behavior of the scalar inference of &#8217;even&#8217;. After presenting my proposal, I discuss its implications for the internal structure of DPs and show that it offers a new structural diagnostic for the derivational path of movement. Moreover, the inability of scope reconstruction to feed focus association in English motivates a new approach to syntactic reconstruction. The proposal developed here explains a range constraints on patterns of focus association, and more generally contributes to our understanding of the interaction of syntactic operations such as movement with the semantic and information-structural notion of focus.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new kind of semantic analysis for Japanese head-internal relative clauses (HIRCs), based on new empirical observations concerning the interpretation of HIRCs with quantificational heads. The analysis involves abstraction over the domain of the HIRC&#8217;s head quantifier via null operator movement. The entire HIRC is then interpreted as a definite description, using a maximal informativeness semantics for definiteness (von Fintel, Fox, and Iatridou 2012) and an assumption about the role of context in the interpretation of referential expressions. This analysis accounts for the new data, the island sensitivity of HIRCs, and the fact that quantificational heads take scope within the HIRC. Finally, previous analyses for the semantics of Japanese HIRC are discussed in relation to the new data presented. ",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a previously unobserved pattern of morphological blocking in English causatives, which parallels a well-studied pattern of morphological blocking in Japanese causatives (Kuroda, 1965, a.o.). We present evidence of deep parallels between the English and Japanese causatives along with a detailed syntax/semantics for these structures within the framework of Distributed Morphology. We argue that the blocking effect is sensitive not to structural adjacency, as previously argued for Japanese (Harley, 2008), but instead to linear adjacency. Our findings constitute a strong argument for the post-syntactic resolution of derivational morphology, pace Distributed Morphology and contra the Lexicalist Hypothesis. In particular, the sensitivity to linear adjacency shows that the operations relevant to the blocking effect must occur post-linearization, and therefore contributes to our understanding of the timing of post-syntactic operations.",

In this paper I investigate the syntax of Agent Focus in Kaqchikel, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala.

Support for this claim comes from new data on the distribution of Agent Focus in Kaqchikel that show this locality-sensitivity.\n\nThe distribution and realization of Agent Focus will then be modeled using a system of ranked, violable constraints operating over competing derivations. This theoretical choice will be supported by details in the pattern of agreement in Agent Focus. I will then show how rerankings of the proposed constraints can model the attested distribution of Agent Focus in a number of other Mayan languages. I also discuss extensions of this approach to other patterns of anti-agreement.",

(2004) proposes that languages may vary in whether or not they allow for abstraction over degree variables. In previous work, comparatives with clausal standards have been uniformly analyzed cross-linguistically as involving an A&#8217;-movement step abstracting over a degree variable, and thereby predicted to not occur in languages without degree abstraction. The paper shows that clausal comparison without degree abstraction is not only theoretically possible but attested, contributing to the cross-linguistic typology of degree constructions.\n\nI first present evidence from bǐ comparatives involving various types of movement chains, which shows that a phrasal analysis is untenable. I detail the comparative deletion enforced in bǐ comparatives and show that various properties of bǐ comparatives fall out of general constraints on ellipsis parallelism. I then argue that the computation of bǐ comparatives does not&mdash;and cannot---involve abstraction over a degree argument. Gradable predicates in Mandarin can take their degree argument last, allowing for clausal comparison without using degree abstraction.\n",

        "abstract": "More and more researchers in linguistics use large-scale experiments to test hypotheses about the data they research, in addition to more traditional informant work. In this paper we describe a new set of free, open-source tools that allow linguists with little background in programming or experimental methods to post studies online. These tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. Our tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data. Surveys created using the tools described in this paper can be posted on Amazon.com&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, a popular crowdsourcing platform which mediates between &#8216;Requesters&#8217; who can post surveys online and &#8216;Workers&#8217; who complete them. This allows many linguistic surveys to be completed within hours or days and at low costs of $50 or less. Alternatively, researchers can host these randomized experiments on their own servers using a supplied server-side component.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we argue for the existence of covert pied-piping in wh-questions through a previously unnoticed pattern of intervention effects in superiority-obeying English multiple wh-questions. We show that the preference of covert pied-piping is for movement of larger constituents, unlike overt pied-piping. We argue that this discrepancy stems from conflicting requirements of PF and LF: overt pied-piping feeds both LF and PF, but covert pied-piping feeds LF only. The study of covert pied-piping thus reveals the true preference of LF and Core Syntax with regard to pied-piping: larger pied-piping constituents are preferred over smaller ones. This preference can be overridden by certain PF constraints that apply to overt pied-piping.",

        "abstract": "A common property of many Mayan languages is a change to transitive verb morphology when the subject has been extracted, known as Agent Focus (AF) (Aissen, 1999; Stiebels, 2006; Norcliffe, 2009; Coon et al., 2011, a.o.). AF is traditionally described as obligatory whenever the subject (ergative argument) is A&#8217;-extracted. In this paper I will discuss the morphological realization of AF in Kaqchikel. I argue that the realization of AF in Kaqchikel must be governed by a morphological process which is independent of the syntax of AF. Specifically, I argue that AF morphology is the realization of an abstract [AF] feature which spreads downwards within a certain domain, following Bjorkman&#8217;s (ms) feature-spreading approach to Affix Hopping-type verbal morphology.",

        "abstract": "While the syntax of wh-in-situ in Mandarin Chinese has been central to discussions of the linguistic theory of covert movement (Huang, 1982), little attention has been paid to the syntax and semantics of alternative questions in Mandarin. I argue that alternative-question-triggering disjunctions in Mandarin are interpreted <em>in-situ</em> at LF using a process of alternative computation, supported by evidence from island sensitivity and focus intervention effects. I offer a proposal for the different semantics of alternative-question-triggering disjunction (<em>háishì</em>) and logical disjunction (<em>hùozhe</em>), in languages such as Mandarin which lexicalize this difference, and show that it can explain the distribution of question &#8220;force&#8221; in Mandarin clauses involving disjunction.",

        "abstract": "This paper argues against Direct Analysis approaches to the Mandarin <em>bǐ</em> comparative construction. Instead, I propose that the derivation of a <em>bǐ</em> comparative involves the construction of two full TPs: one for the target and one for the standard. This view is motivated by comparatives where material has moved simultaneously from the predicate into the target and into the standard, which are difficult to capture within a Direct Analysis. A technical implementation of this proposal is presented in which common material in the two TPs&#8217; predicates is obligatorily multidominated. ",

Following work on Chinese Sentence-Final Particles (SFP), <em>éryǐ</em> syntactically is in the CP-domain and thus should scope above TP-level operators such as negation, and this is indeed normally the case. However, the introduction of the focus marker <em>shì</em> can force the sentence-final <em>éryǐ</em> to take scope below the TP-level negation, creating a problem for the theory of Mandarin SFP.\n\nI propose that <em>shì</em> unambiguously marks the semantic scope of Mandarin focus-sensitive operators which involve Association With Focus. I show how this analysis preserves the expected syntactic cartography while computing the correct semantic scope. A compositional syntax/semantics utilizing focus movement is also presented.",
