        "year": "2022",
        "abstract": "The grammatical approach to scalar implicatures (SI) posits a covert operator <em>exh</em> whose semantic contribution is similar to that of an exhaustive focus particle such as <em>only</em> (Fox 2007, Chierchia et al. 2012, a.o.). While its proponents have argued for the availability of <em>exh</em> in embedded positions, constraints on its precise placement are not well understood. In this work, we argue that certain “triggers” of SI in English — unstressed <em>some</em>, disjunction, and bare numerals — require an associated <em>exh</em> to be as low as possible above the trigger. This requirement is however lexicalized, as we show that other triggers such as stressed <em>SOME</em> allow for more delayed exhaustification.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aw1OdJZ4zt8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

        "abstract": "We investigate an understudied phenomenon in the grammar of Pangasinan (northern Philippines), termed argument “apposition” in the Benton 1971 grammar of the language, supported by original elicitation work. Benton observes that arguments in Pangasinan are frequently introduced not by a run-of-the-mill case-marked nominal, but instead by a pronoun followed by a corresponding noun phrase (which we call the “associate”) which “identif[ies] the entity represented by the pronoun” (Benton, 1971: 145). \n\nWhat is the relationship between the pronoun and the corresponding associate phrase? Based on novel evidence from binding and movement, we propose that these associates are not in regular argument positions and are built apart from their corresponding pronouns — thus similar to right dislocation/afterthoughts in other languages and supporting Benton’s “apposition” description but later syntactically integrated into and linearized within the clause.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zE2Zk1aiSxA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

        "abstract": "We describe the various uses of the Vietnamese morpheme <em>quá</em> which appears in excessive constructions. Unlike other degree morphemes in Vietnamese, <em>quá</em> can precede or follow its gradable predicate, and we argue that these two different uses convey excess in very different ways: pre-predicate <em>quá</em> encodes purpose-oriented excessive truth conditions, whereas post-predicate quá is a comparative which projects a not-at-issue malefactive inference. We also describe two additional, non-excessive uses of <em>quá</em> — as an intensifier with speaker commitment and in the formation of exclamatives — and argue that these uses must be distinguished from the core excessive uses. This paper thus offers a case study of a highly multifunctional morpheme, with discussion of the syntactic and semantic relationships between these different uses.",

Benton’s 1971 grammar of Pangasinan describes the <em>aga</em> form of negation as occurring specifically with third-singular pivot arguments, which if correct would constitute a typologically unusual instance of marked thirdsingular morphology. We argue against this characterization and instead propose that <em>aga</em> is an allomorph of <em>ag</em> historically motivated by a disyllabic word minimum requirement, with some conventionalized restrictions on its distribution. We offer an explanation for its incorrect previous descriptions and discuss similar alternations between monosyllabic and disyllabic allomorphs of negation in other Austronesian languages and consequences for the prosodic status of second-position clitics.",

        "year": "2021",
        "abstract": "Since the early 1970’s, the analysis of focus has played a central role in discussions of the architecture of grammar. Focus refers to the identiﬁcation of a part of the sentence as standing in contrast to contextually-determined alternatives (see e.g. Krifka, 2008). Interpretationally, changes in focus placement lead to diﬀerences in discourse congruence, as well as truth-conditional semantics (see e.g. Rooth, 1992). Morphophonologically, focus placement may aﬀect stress placement or result in other morphosyntactic marking. Form-meaning correspondences in focus placement naturally lead to questions of modularity. Jackendoﬀ (1972: 240) proposed the idea of F-marking: “a syntactic marker F which can be associated with any node...”, which then feeds the semantics (Rooth 1985 et seq), morphosyntax, and prosody. Now, ﬁfty years later, we revisit this question: <em>Is there really F-marking in the narrow syntax?</em>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/96TVzTWiolQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

We discuss explicit options for the search algorithm underlying \"minimal search,\" the need to distinguish probe interaction from satisfaction, and the shape of the search space. We describe how versions of this procedural approach can derive a wide range of attested relative and absolute locality effects.",

Bare nouns are interpreted as singular deﬁnites, to which the numeral ‘one’ is added to form indeﬁnites. We propose that ‘one’ restricts the domain of the nominal to a singleton, and that its addition is subject to a Non-Vacuity constraint; this is the source of the anti-uniqueness inference of indeﬁnites. We furthermore investigate the availability of ‘one’ in anaphoric deﬁnites. Such behavior forms an argument that the compositional semantics of anaphoric deﬁnites does not involve contextual restriction via a situation variable, unlike unique deﬁnites.\n\n<strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"/research/burmese-indef.html\">our Triple A paper</a>, which provides a more complete description of (in)definiteness distinctions in Burmese.\n",

Indeﬁnites use the numeral ‘one.’ We develop an analysis based on Jenks’ analysis of Mandarin Chinese deﬁnites, extended with a novel proposal for ‘one’ indeﬁnites. Indeﬁnites introduce an antiuniqueness inference, which we derive from a Non-Triviality constraint rather than Maximize Presupposition à la Heim 1991, with crucial evidence from anaphoric deﬁnites with ‘one.’ We also describe the availability of bare noun indefinite objects, which we analyze as a form of (pseudo) noun incorporation.\n\n<strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"/research/burmese-antiuniqueness.html\">our companion SALT paper</a>, which further develops the analysis of &#8216;one’ indefinites\n",

        "abstract": "Pangasinan (Austronesian; northern Philippines) has case marking and some agreement and generally free postverbal word order. However, in a particular, limited configuration where case and agreement fail to disambiguate between core arguments, their word order becomes rigid. We argue that these facts are explained by a feature-driven approach to scrambling, where scrambling probes can only target morphosyntactic features and not A&#8217;-features. This work shows that the well-known trade-off between word order rigidity and overt case/agreement is not merely a typological tendency, but can also be observed in an individual&#8217;s synchronic grammar.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXVGkytDzRI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

        "abstract": "We document and investigate <em>anti-pied-piping</em>, a cross-linguistically widespread but understudied phenomenon where a language targets a proper subpart of the logical focus for focus morphosyntax, e.g. focus particle placement or focus movement. We develop a theory of focus particle placement which successfully generates both anti-pied-piping and pied-piping behavior, which in many cases results in a separation between the pronounced position of a focus particle and the logical position of its corresponding semantic contribution. Constraints on attested anti-pied-piping behavior and its interaction with movement show that particle placement takes place at particular, punctuated points in the derivation, in a cyclic model of syntactic structure-building. We also discuss the relation of particle placement to other processes such as stress assignment and discuss consequences for the status of focus in grammar.",

Morphologically, <em>yin.na’ang</em> is a transparent combination of a copula, conditional ending, and <em>even</em>. In this talk, I document these uses of <em>yin.na’ang</em> from original fieldwork and propose a compositional semantics which derives this range of uses. Finally, I briefly discuss similar phenomena in Dravidian languages (Balusu 2019, 2020) and with Japanese demo, which cover the range of uses in (a–c) and also derive from similar ingredients.\n\n<a href=\"/research/tibetan-yine-nels.html\"><strong>See NELS proceedings paper</strong></a> and <a href=\"/research/tibetan-fc.html\"><strong>manuscript on universal free choice</strong></a>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBIFLRFkKkc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

        "abstract": "We report on the interpretation of diﬀerent forms of singular argument nominals in Burmese, a language without articles, from original ﬁeldwork. Like in Mandarin Chinese (Jenks, 2018), bare nouns are unique deﬁnites, with demonstratives used for anaphoric deﬁnites. Indeﬁnites use the numeral ‘one.’ We develop an analysis based on Jenks’ analysis of Mandarin Chinese deﬁnites, extended with a novel proposal for ‘one’ indeﬁnites. Indeﬁnites introduce an antiuniqueness inference, which we derive from a Non-Triviality constraint rather than Maximize Presupposition à la Heim 1991, with crucial evidence from anaphoric deﬁnites with ‘one.’ We also describe the availability of bare noun indefinite objects, which we analyze as a form of (pseudo) noun incorporation.",

Such an Ā-probe specification is part of the influential Aldridge 2004, 2008 analysis of syntactically ergative extraction restrictions, but has not been widely adopted outside of work on ergative languages. We argue that restricted probing of this form underlies subject-only extraction behaviors in a number of non-ergative languages, including some of those in Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) typology of relativization asymmetries. We describe the behaviors of such probes in detail and relate them to other probe-goal behaviors in recent work on composite A/Ā probes.",

I demonstrate that the conventional semantics of these ingredients successfully combine to derive universal free choice meaning. This motivates a new approach to the compositional semantics of universal free choice, which does not prescribe its universal force. This quantiﬁcational force is parasitic on the modal/temporal operator which is restricted by the conditional; the scalar ‘even’ particle then ensures that the conditional restricts a necessity modal.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes three constraints that together govern the distribution of the exhaustive focus marker <em>shì</em> in Mandarin Chinese. First, I argue that <em>shì</em> is a sentential focus particle that is subject to a requirement to adjoin as low as possible within its clause or phase. Second, I show that <em>shì</em> requires a congruent Question Under Discussion (QUD) and demonstrate the effects of this semantic constraint on the distribution of <em>shì</em>. Third and finally, I show that there are certain reduced clauses where <em>shì</em> is completely disallowed, although other focus particles such as &#8216;only&#8217; may appear. I propose that this last restriction is a particular proposal for the syntax/semantics of discourse congruence: reference to a QUD &mdash; required by the semantics of <em>shì</em> &mdash; is mediated by a functional head in the high CP periphery. <em>Shì</em> is thus unavailable in reduced clauses which do not project this high functional layer.",

        "abstract": "The Tibetan particle <em>yin.n&#8217;ang</em> has three uses: (a) as a counterexpectational discourse particle (like English &#8217;but&#8217; or &#8217;however&#8217;), (b) as a scalar concessive particle, and (c) to form free choice items with <em>wh</em>-words. Morphologically, <em>yin.n&#8217;ang</em> is transparently the combination of a copular verb, conditional ending, and scalar particle (e.g. &#8217;even&#8217;).

        "abstract": "In both Tibetan and so-called Philippine-type Austronesian languages, the form of the verb varies with the choice of relative clause pivot, with different forms chosen for the relativization of actors, patients, locatives/goals, and instruments. These alternations have however been described in very different ways in their respective literatures. In the Bodic literature, these verb forms have been described as different nominalizations which can be juxtaposed to a noun to modify it (DeLancey 1999, Noonan 2008, a.o.). In the Austronesian literature, these alternations reflect different grammatical voices, with relativization obeying a subject-only or absolutive-only restriction (Keenan & Comrie 1977, Aldridge 2004, a.o.). In this talk, I compare these systems, concentrating on the behavior of relativization of an embedded clause argument, i.e. long-distance relativization. Original data on long-distance relativization in Tibetan, which has not been previously described, shows clear parallels to the well-studied behavior of long-distance relativization in Austronesian languages, and leads to an argument against the nominalization analysis of these verb forms in Tibetan.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qng7auLtxsE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

(Cf. <em>pied-piping</em>, where a constituent that properly contains the focus (or <em>wh</em>) is MSF.) Anti-pied-piping is observed in many languages, but has not received significant previous attention. We show that anti-pied-piping is not entirely postsyntactic, as it feeds later movement, but it cross-linguistically displays a linear leftmost preference, characteristic of a PF phenomenon. We propose that focus particle placement takes place during cyclic Spell-Out (by phase), making (anti-)pied-piping sensitive to linearization but then feeding further syntactic operations.",

One argument of each clause (the \"subject\") is in a dedicated form and/or position, affecting the case-marking and/or word order of other arguments. We posit two parameters to explain case and word order properties of non-subject arguments: (i) accusative parameter: the language does/does not have structural accusative case; (ii) last-resort licensing parameter: DPs lacking Case-licensing are licensed under adjacency with the verb or by insertion of a case-marker (genitive).

        "abstract": "We discuss the treatment of movement and variable binding across ﬁnite clause boundaries in the continuation-based grammar of Barker and Shan (2014) and related work. We propose extensions to the theory which make such dependencies compatible with a ban on cross-clausal scope-taking as implemented in Charlow (2014). We demonstrate, however, that this resulting grammar systematically makes incorrect predictions for weak crossover in sentences that combine long-distance movement and variable binding, thus undermining one of the major advantages of continuation-based grammars according to Shan and Barker (2006). We conclude with a critical outlook and a comparison to contemporary LF syntax approaches to scope-taking.",

        "abstract": "In many languages, A&#8217;-extraction of local subject arguments behaves differently from the extraction of other arguments, for example in triggering specialized morphosyntactic processes or being subject to additional restrictions. I argue that many such interactions are due to an anti-locality constraint on movement, which bans movement which is too short. Subject extraction is often distinguished due to the high canonical position of subjects in their clauses (e.g. Spec,TP), making their movement to the clause edge (e.g. Spec,CP) uniquely in danger of violating the Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality constraint <a href=“/research/af.html”>(Erlewine 2016)</a>. Concretely, three subject extraction asymmetry behaviors are discussed and analyzed: complementizer-trace effects, subject anti-agreement effects, and bans on subject resumption, including the so-called Highest Subject Restriction. In each case, we observe that the special behavior associated with subject extraction (a) can be obviated by increasing the distance of movement, (b) also applies to exceptionally high non-subjects, and (c) does not correlate with other subjecthood properties. These facts are straightforwardly explained by the anti-locality-based approach to these asymmetries, but are challenging for alternative accounts.",

I present a framework for the compositional semantics of alternatives which models various attested forms of <em>wh</em>-quantification, and helps us explain the prevalent use of disjunctors and focus particles in <em>wh</em>-quantification. This work builds on existing descriptions of <em>wh</em>-quantification, but also builds on original data and analyses from Toba Batak (Austronesian), Tibetan, and Burmese.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hv1WoQJN3CI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Morphologically, <em>yin.na’ang</em> is a transparent combination of a copula, conditional ending, and <em>even</em>. In this talk, I document these uses of <em>yin.na’ang</em> from original fieldwork and propose a compositional semantics which derives this range of uses. Finally, I briefly discuss the extension of this analysis to similar expressions in Dravidian languages (Balusu 2019) and Japanese <em>demo</em>, which cover the range of uses in (a–c) and also derive (for Japanese, historically) from similar ingredients.\n\n<a href=\"/research/tibetan-yine-nels.html\"><strong>See NELS proceedings paper</strong></a> and <a href=\"/research/tibetan-fc.html\"><strong>manuscript on universal free choice</strong></a>",

        "abstract": "The Burmese particle <em>hmá</em> expresses cleft-like exhaustivity in some contexts but a scalar, <em>even</em>-like meaning in other contexts. We propose that <em>hmá</em> is uniformly a not-at-issue scalar exhaustive, with semantics similar to that proposed for English <em>it</em>-clefts in Velleman, Beaver, Destruel, Bumford, Onea, and Coppock 2012. When <em>hmá</em> takes wide scope, it leads to an exhaustive interpretation which is not scale-sensitive. When <em>hmá</em> takes scope under negation, the resulting expression will have a scale-sensitive felicity condition due to a Non-Vacuity constraint. We show that <em>hmá</em> makes reference to alternatives ordered by likelihood, but cannot use other contextual orderings such as rank-orders.\n\nWe also analyze the sentence-final mood marker <em>ta/da</em>, which frequently but not always appears in scalar <em>hmá</em> utterances, in a manner similar to focus concord effects in other languages. We propose that <em>ta/da</em> is a marker of propositional clefts and argue that the semantics of <em>hmá</em> and the pragmatic requirements of propositional clefts together derive this apparent focus concord effect, as well as its exceptions.\n",

        "abstract": "Austronesian voice system languages are well-known for their “subject-only” restriction on A’-extraction. We show that topicalization in Bikol (Central Philippines) and its interactions with long-distance clefting supports a locality-based conception of the extraction restriction. Although local clefting is strictly subject-only, local topicalization can target subjects or non-subject agents. In contrast, long-distance clefting can target embedded subjects or embedded non-subject agents. We propose that in such cases, embedded topicalization feeds higher clefting. We consider and argue against alternative conceptions of the Austronesian “subject-only” extraction restriction.",

Previous work on Tibetan such as DeLancey 1999 describe different &#8216;&#8216;nominalizer’’ morphemes used for the relativization of subjects, locative/goals, instruments, and themes. New data from long-distance relatives shows that so-called &#8216;&#8216;nominalizers’’ are comprised of two distinct classes of morphemes: the historically oldest marker, <em>-pa</em>, always appears at the edge of the entire relative clause, whereas the other morphemes reflect a particular type of local extraction. I also argue that relativization cannot be reduced to nominalization, contrary to previous descriptions.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the syntax and semantics of Singlish (Colloquial Singapore English) sentence-final <em>already</em> and its development in the contact ecology of Singapore. Bao 2005 identifies the Mandarin Chinese perfective suffix <em>-le</em> and sentence-final particle <em>le</em> as two substrate sources for Singlish <em>already</em>. In this paper, I first argue instead that sentence-final <em>le</em> — together with its cognate <em>liao/laa</em> in other Chinese languages of Singapore — is the sole substrate source for the syntax and semantics of Singlish <em>already</em>. The various interpretational effects of <em>already</em> can be derived from a uniform semantics shared with its substrate cognate particles <em>le/liau/laa</em>, together with consideration of the telicity of the predicate. I furthermore show that the syntax of <em>already</em> differs subtly from that of its substrate cognates: Singlish sentence-final <em>already</em> unambiguously scopes over the entire clause, whereas its substrate cognate particles <em>le/liau/laa</em> are in a clause-medial position. I propose that this difference can be explained through a process of reanalysis forced by the interaction of a syntactic universal, the Final-over-Final Constraint, together with independent differences between Singlish and its substrate Chinese languages.",

This gap teaches us about the organization of the lower phase edge. As cliticization involves a syntactic dependency between the host and argument position and all syntactic dependencies are constrained by phases, the gap is explained if pivots and non-pivot agents are speciﬁers of the phase head, making them the only DPs accessible for operations from outside of the phase.",

We detail the distribution of these uses of <em>hma</em> and develop a uni\u0002ed semantics. We propose that <em>hma</em> is a not-at-issue scalar exhaustive, with semantics similar to that proposed for English <em>it</em>-clefts in Velleman, Beaver, Destruel, Bumford, Onea & Coppock 2012. When <em>hma</em> takes wide scope, it leads to an exhaustive, cleft interpretation which is not scale-sensitive. When <em>hma</em> takes scope under negation, the resulting meaning will have a scale-sensitive felicity condition. We also discuss the semantics of the sentence-\u0002final mood marker <em>dar</em>, which we propose is a marker of propositional clefts (Sheil 2016), and its apparent role in the determination of the scope of <em>hma</em>.",

        "abstract": "Many Austronesian languages exhibit an extraction restriction whereby only one particular DP — the “pivot” argument, the choice of which is reﬂected by morphology on the verb — can be Ā-extracted. We show that such extraction restrictions can vary between different Ā-constructions in Bikol: local clefting is limited to the pivot, whereas topicalization can target pivots and non-pivot agents but not non-pivot themes of transitive verbs. Following the phase-theoretic, locality-based approach to such extraction asymmetries in related Austronesian languages, we propose that clefting and topicalization differ in the featural speciﬁcations of their probes, with clefting necessarily targeting the closest DP and topicalization simply seeking the closest topic constituent. Evidence for this approach comes from the behavior of long-distance clefting, which may target certain non-pivot arguments and involve gaps or resumptive pronouns. The inventory of different long-distance cleft types is explained by the possibility of embedded topicalization and hanging topic left dislocation feeding higher clefting. Our study strengthens the view that the classic Austronesian pivot-only extraction restriction is best characterized in terms of syntactic locality, rather than as a restriction on the grammatical function or morphological case of movement targets.",

        "abstract": "We propose that much of the variation amongst Austronesian voice system languages in post-verbal word order and the marking of non-pivot arguments can be productively understood by considering differences in the strategies of nominal licensing (Case). We propose two parameters: (i) the accusative parameter: the language does or does not have structural accusative case; (ii) the last-resort licensing parameter: DPs without structural Case-licensing may be licensed either under adjacency with the verb or by insertion of a case marker (genitive). Toba Batak, Balinese, Nanwang Puyuma, and Katipul/Ulivelivek Puyuma exemplify the four language types predicted by these parameters. We also discuss extensions of this approach to Tagalog and Malagasy.",

We follow the view that intervention effects reflect a particular LF configuration (Beck 2006 a.o.), but in contrast to previous approaches, we propose that any DP can lead to intervention if it is interpreted in a derived position above a wh-phrase at LF. Quantifiers which appear to be non-interveners are able to avoid this configuration. Intervention is limited to quantifiers interpreted in a derived position via movement, which supports the theory of intervention effects developed in Kotek 2017 as reflecting a logical incompatibility between the Predicate Abstraction rule and the computation of Rooth-Hamblin alternatives.",

        "abstract": "Colloquial Burmese has a particle <em>ma</em> which in some contexts has an exhaustive use and in other contexts seems to be a scalar particle. Okell’s 1969 reference grammar describes these two uses simply as “hmaA” &#8216;even’ and “hmaB ” &#8216;only’ without describing their distributions. In addition, <em>ma</em> takes <em>wh</em>-phrases to form NPIs.\n\nWe describe the distributions of each of these uses and offer a unified semantics for <em>ma</em> which derives these uses. <em>ma</em> is a not-at-issue scalar exhaustive, expressing that all less likely alternatives are false, akin to Velleman et al’s analysis of clefts. When <em>ma</em> takes wide scope, it contributes exhaustivity, but under the scope of negation, its felicitous use is dependent on the relative likelihood of the prejacent.\n\nWe also offer an analysis for the use of the mood ending <em>–dar</em> as a propositional cleft, explaining its co-occurrance with scalar uses of <em>ma</em>.",

This gap teaches us about the organization of the lower phase edge. As cliticization involves a syntactic dependency between the host and argument position and all syntactic dependencies are constrained by phases, the gap is explained if pivots and non-pivot agents are speciﬁers of the phase head, making them the only DPs accessible for operations from outside of the phase.",

We show that topicalization can target non-subject agents, although local clefting is strictly limited to the subject. We propose that topicalization involves a [TOP] probe, which can skip a non-topic subject, whereas clefting involves probing for [D], which cannot skip the subject (Aldridge 2004, 2017). Subjects and non-subject agents are the only DPs at the edge of the vP phase edge, explaining the impossibility of topicalizing non-subject themes. Finally, we show that topicalization can feed long-distance clefting, supporting the view that apparent &#8220;subject-only’’ extraction restriction on clefting is not based on thematic role, but rather locality-based.",

The characterization of which quantifiers are interveners, and the nature of intervention itself, has been subject to great debate. We show that the following holds in Japanese: The intervention/scope-rigidity generalization: Scope-rigid quantifiers above an insitu wh cause intervention. Quantifiers that allow scope ambiguities - i.e., those that allow reconstruction - do not. This correlation is explained by a widely-discussed incompatibility between predicate abstraction (for quantifier scope-taking) and the computation of Rooth-Hamblin alternatives (for <em>wh</em>-in-situ).",

Bao (1995, 2005) proposes that <em>already</em> is a relexification inheriting the syntax/semantics of Chinese sentence-final <em>le/liao</em>. The semantic scope of Singlish <em>already</em> shows that it unambiguously attaches high to its host clause (above TP), whereas Chinese <em>le/liao</em> attaches between VP and TP. This discrepancy in height is explained by an interaction between the Final-over-Final Constraint (Biberauer, Holmberts, and Roberts 2014 a.o.), enforced over Spell-Out domains, and verbal inflection suspending Spell-Out at vP in Singlish but not Chinese.",

A&#8217;-extraction of the subject thus may uniquely run afowl of anti-locality constraints on movement, which ban movement which is too close (see e.g. Grohmann 2003, Cheng 2007, Erlewine 2016, 2017, Bošković 2016, Douglas 2016). Quirks of subject extraction that are driven by anti-locality constraints exhibit a particular \"signature\": (a) obviation when additional material is added above the subject, (b) its applicability to non-subjects that are exceptionally high, and (c) no correlation with other subjecthood properties such as case. Relevant examples from Highest Subject Restriction, subject anti-agreement, and complementizer-trace effects are discussed.",

Alternative questions use <em>háishi</em> whereas logical, boolean disjunction is expressed with <em>huòzhe</em>. Building on previous decompositional analyses of disjunction, I propose that <em>háishi</em> spells out the junctor head J which projects its disjuncts as Roothian alternatives, whereas <em>huòzhe</em> spells out a version of the J head that must be existential closed, forming a quantifier. This account contrasts from previous work on disjunction in Mandarin, which requires <em>hàishi</em> to move at LF or which requires the two disjunctors to differ in the size of disjuncts. Evidence comes from focus intervention effects and island (in)sensitivity.\n\nI also consider environments where <em>háishi</em> and <em>huòzhe</em> are interchangeable, with disjunctive or conjunctive interpretation, which are also precisely where <em>wh</em>-phrases are used quantificationally. I offer a semantic characterization for these environments and argue against possible syntactic accounts. The distributions and interpretations of these disjunctors and <em>wh</em>-phrases in Mandarin Chinese form an argument for the two-dimensional Roothian Alternative Semantics framework over similar one-dimensional frameworks such as Hamblin semantics, from an empirical domain other than focus.",

        "abstract": "I report on the use and distribution of <em>manang</em> in Toba Batak, an Austronesian language of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. <em>Manang</em> is used to form logical disjunctions, alternative questions, <em>wh</em>-Negative Polarity Items (NPIs), and <em>wh</em>-Free Choice Items (FCIs), and also appears optionally on embedded questions. It does not, however, form simple <em>wh</em>-indefinites.\n\nI propose that <em>manang</em> is the spellout of maximally two logical operators: <strong>J</strong>, which collects the ordinary semantic values of disjuncts into a set of alternatives, and <strong>∃</strong>, which creates an existential quantifier from a set of alternatives. Using a two-dimensional Alternative Semantics (Rooth 1985, 1992), I derive the different disjunctive and <em>wh</em>-quantifying uses of <em>manang</em> and various constraints on their interpretation. I additionally report on the use of <em>manang</em> in embedded questions.",

        "abstract": "Under the influential Roothian proposal for focus association, focused phrases remain in-situ at LF (Rooth, 1985, 1992). However, a recent line of work has resurrected the idea that focus association involves covert movement: specifically, the associate of English sentential only must covertly move to only, with the possibility of covert pied-piping (Drubig, 1994; Krifka, 1996, 2006; Tancredi, 1997, 2004; Wagner, 2006; Erlewine and Kotek, 2014, to appear). In this paper we contribute to this emerging consensus view with additional evidence from reflexive binding and parasitic gap licensing.\n\n<strong>This paper supplements <a href=\"/research/tanglewood.html\">“Focus association by movement: Evidence from <em>Tanglewood</em>“</a> in <em>LI</em>.</strong>",

In this talk, I investigate structural restrictions on the position of focus-sensitive operators and their foci, in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese. I show that in both languages, focus-sensitive sentential adverbs must be as low as possible in their phase while taking their focus associates in their scope, similar to what has been described (controversially) for German by Jacobs (1983) and Büring & Hartmann (2001). I show that this “as low as possible” requirement is a strict, syntactic constraint rather than one which is semantically sensitive. I argue that its relativization to individual phases provides a new kind of evidence for the idea of the cyclic construction of syntactic structure.",

        "abstract": "Argument ellipsis refers to the phenomenon of unpronounced nominal arguments that are interpreted as full noun phrases. One particularly influential account claims that argument ellipsis is possible if and only if the argument is not φ-agreed with — the Anti-Agreement Hypothesis (Saito 2007, Şener and Takahashi 2010). Otaki, Sugisaki, Yusa, and Koizumi (2013) show that null subjects and objects in Kaqchikel are not interpreted as full noun phrases, and therefore not the result of argument ellipsis. They say that these facts lend support to the Anti-Agreement Hypothesis, given that Kaqchikel verbs agree with both subjects and objects. \n\nIn this paper, we consider additional syntactic environments not considered by Otaki et al. and show that the interpretation of Kaqchikel null arguments in fact cannot be held up as support for the Anti-Agreement Hypothesis. The empirical testing ground we introduce is the Agent Focus construction in Kaqchikel, where transitive verbs only exhibit φ-agreement with one argument (see e.g. Preminger, 2011, 2014, Erlewine, 2016). We show that, in Agent Focus constructions, even arguments that are not Agreed with disallow argument ellipsis. This fuller set of data from Kaqchikel thus provides empirical and conceptual evidence against the Anti-Agreement Hypothesis for argument ellipsis, contrary to the conclusions of Otaki et al.",

I show that this &#8220;as low as possible&#8221; requirement cannot be violated even in order to yield a different meaning. Within a phase-based, bottom-up conception of structure-building, I analyze this behavior as the result of sentential focus particles adjoining as early as possible while being interpretable. The fact that this requirement only holds between different adjunction positions in each phase is naturally explained by the theory of derivation by phase (Chomsky, 2000, 2001) and provides a new kind of evidence for this form of cyclic structure-building. This work also provides cross-linguistic support for one aspect of the controversial analysis of German focus particles as sentential modifiers (Jacobs, 1983, 1986; Büring and Hartmann, 2001), which similarly requires an &#8216;&#8216;as low as possible&#8221; requirement on sentential focus particles.\n\n<strong>See also <a href=\"/research/minimality-focus.html\">“Minimality and focus-sensitive adverb placement”</a> in <em>NELS 45</em>, which discusses various alternative analyses.</strong>",

        "abstract": "Mandarin Chinese clausal syntax can be described as strictly head-initial, with the exception of certain &#8220;particles&#8221; which are linearized at the end of the clause. Previous work on these sentence-final particles (SFPs) has assumed that all SFPs are very high, in the CP periphery. In the absence of information from linear order, I consider the semantic scope of these SFPs to determine their structural height. Using evidence from scopal interaction with negation, modals, quantificational subjects, and alternative question disjunction, I show that a subset of SFPs&mdash;specifically, sentence-final <em>le</em> and <em>éryǐ</em> &#8216;only,&#8217; both in the lowest class of SFPs (Paul, 2014, 2015)&ndash;-are in a lower, clause-medial position. I identify the position of these low SFPs as coinciding with the edge of the lower phase, traditionally identified as vP.\n\nAs SFPs are head-final heads with head-initial complements, they have been discussed as an important apparent exception to theFinal-over-Final Constraint (FOFC; Holmberg 2000; Biberauer, Holmberg, and Roberts 2014), a proposed universal on structure-building and linearization. Iargue that the very limited distribution of apparent FOFC violations should be taken to support a modification to FOFC, rather than its outright rejection (contra Paul 2015). In particular, the existence of apparent exceptions to FOFC in a clause-medialposition in addition to the CP edge motivatesthe view that FOFC holds onlywithin individual Spell-Out domains. I hypothesize that languages that previously have been shown to obey FOFC across these domains are also languages with richer verbal morphology, which can be taken to extend or suspend Spell-Out of the lower phase. Apparent exceptions to FOFC are thus predicted to be possible (a) at phase boundaries (b) in analytic languages. This helps to explain previous observations that certain sets of languages, especially with little to no verbal inflection, are more prone to heads that seem to run counter to FOFC.",

Nakanishi’s argument is based on the assumption that <em>even</em> cannot associate with a focus which has moved out of its LF scope. I show that this assumption is incorrect, defusing Nakanishi’s argument.\n\nI propose that when <em>even</em> associates with a focus which has moved out of its surface scope, it actually associates with focused material in the lower copies of movement (trace positions). I show that a closer look at ACD examples of Nakanishi’s type in fact forms a new argument against the scope theory. I conclude that English VP-<em>even</em> must always be interpreted in its pronounced position.

I unify the behavior of <em>shì</em> in declaratives with the understudied behavior of <em>shì</em> in questions. I discuss the syntax/semantics of QUD congruence and differences between the distribution of <em>shì</em> and &#8216;only.&#8217;",

Contrary to the claims of previous work on the language (especially Cole and Hermon 2008), I show that multiple, simultaneous extractions to the left periphery is possible, though only in limited configurations. The pattern of possible and impossible multiple extractions motivates a particular organization of the left periphery: specifically, features associated with C and T begin on a single head, probing together, and then splitting if joint probing yields no matching target. I model this using CT head-splitting (Martinović 2015). The distribution of the optional particle <em>na</em> further supports this approach. Finally, I discuss lessons for the analysis of Austronesian voice and the role of Case.\n\n<strong>For full discussion, see <a href=\"/research/batak.html\">“Extraction and licensing in Toba Batak”</a>.</strong>",

Indefinite free relatives in Chuj are equivalent in size to definite free relatives, contrary to a well-supported conjecture by Šimík (2011) that indefinite free relatives are always reduced clauses (specifically, modal existential <em>wh</em>-constructions). We show that the non-island status of indefinite free relatives is due to their being CPs without a DP layer; it is not the case that extraction out of relative clauses on indefinites can somehow proceed without island violations. We also present supporting evidence from two other Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya and Kaqchikel.",

        "abstract": "Nakanishi 2012 presents a novel argument for the so-called “scope theory” of English VP-<em>even</em>, based on examples with antecedent-contained deletion (ACD). Nakanishi’s argument is based on the assumption that even cannot associate with a focus which has moved out of its scope. I show that this assumption is incorrect, defusing Nakanishi’s argument. I propose that when <em>even</em> associates with a focus which has moved out of its scope, it actually associates with focused material in the lower copies of movement (trace positions). I show that a closer look at ACD examples of Nakanishi’s type in fact forms a new argument against the scope theory. I conclude that English VP-<em>even</em> must always be interpreted in its pronounced position. The patterns of focus association with even presented here constitute a new argument for the copy theory of movement.",

        "year": "2016",
        "abstract": "This paper contributes experimental evidence regarding the question of how relative pronouns are interpreted in English non-restrictive relative clauses with relative pronoun pied- piping (RPPP). Kotek and Erlewine (2015) and Erlewine and Kotek (to appear) claim that the wh-relative pronoun is sensitive to intervention effects inside its pied-piping constituent (cf Sauerland and Heck, 2003; Cable, 2010; Kotek and Erlewine, to appear). In this paper we present the results of a web-based grammaticality judgment survey which supports this claim. We discuss the nature of the intervention judgment, which is notoriously subtle, and how it might be modeled in grammar. The sensitivity of RPPP to intervention effects has important implications for the formal analysis of English non-restrictive relative clauses, supporting the view that relative pronouns are interpreted in-situ without covert movement out of its pied-piping.\n\n<strong>This paper reports on experimental evidence to support <a href=\"/research/tanglewood.html\">“The structure and interpretation of non-restrictive relatives”</a> in <em>CLS 51</em>.</strong>",

However, I show that this c-command requirement is insufficient to capture the distribution of focus adverbs (e.g. &#8216;only&#8217;) in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese. Focus adverbs in these languages must be as low as possible while c-commanding their focus associate, within a particular extended vP domain. The generalization is similar to what has been described for German by Jacobs (1983) and Büring & Hartmann (2001), but without a formal account.\n\nI present an analysis which derives the behavior observed in Mandarin and Vietnamese using a system of ranked, violable constraints. Optimizing cyclically, rather than globally, at each phase level, allows for apparent optionality in the position of focus adverbs and correctly identifies the vP edge as the locus of operators which associate long-distance. I show how this general system can also extend to the behavior of Romance, Bantu, and Chadic languages where foci are required to be low in the clause.",

We will show that Chuj can use <em>wh</em>-words to form indefinites in certain limited environments, and that it can additionally use <em>wh</em>-words to form free choice items and a universal quantifier. In addition, Chuj uses <em>wh</em>-words to form free relatives, including definite free relatives but also typologically rare indefinite free relatives.",

        "abstract": "We offer a new, unified approach to the derivation and interpretation of head-external, head-internal, and heretofore understudied doubly-headed relative clauses in Japanese. Our proposal is motivated by new data on the interpretation of these different forms of relative clauses with quantificational heads, in different contexts. Head-internal and doubly-headed relative clauses are interpreted as definite descriptions with their quantificational head interpreted in their surface, relative-clause-internal positions. We show that the complex patterns of possible interpretations, as well as the shape of observed inter-speaker variation, are derived by interpreting definite descriptions using a maximal informativeness semantics and a simple assumption regarding the role of contextual information, which we call the <em>Salient Sets Restriction</em>. \n\nSyntactically, we propose a novel DP head-raising derivation for relative clauses that takes advantage of the Copy Theory of movement and the late-merger of relative clauses. This allows for the unification of head-internal and doubly-headed relativization strategies with the familiar head-external form, which would otherwise not be possible. We believe this approach is suitable for head-raising relative clauses in other languages as well, including English. Our proposal avoids some complications of previous head-raising derivations, instead taking advantage of independently motivated mechanisms of copy-chain resolution at LF.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate two series of Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) in Dharamsala Tibetan: one series uses the numeral &#8216;one&#8217; with an <em>even</em> particle, with an optional nominal domain. The other series combines a <em>wh</em>-word with the same <em>even</em> particle, and may appear with or without the numeral &#8216;one.&#8217; We discuss the relation of these NPIs to indefinite expressions in Dharamsala Tibetan, and document their syntactic licensing conditions. We show that NPIs are licensed in the scope of a clause-mate negation and in questions, but not in other downward-entailing environments. \n\nWe then present a compositional semantics for these two types of NPIs which explains their negative-polarity dependency, based on Lahiri&#8217;s (1998) analysis of similar constructions in Hindi. Our analysis for <em>wh</em>-<em>even</em> NPIs takes advantage of the Hamblin (1973) denotation of <em>wh</em>-words as sets of alternatives and the fact that <em>even</em> introduces two presuppositions&mdash;an additive one and a scalar one. Allowing the additive component of <em>even</em> to scope independently of the scalar part, the additive part of <em>even</em> is used to generate an indefinite out of the <em>wh</em>-word. The scalar component will be used to ensure that <em>even</em>-NPIs can only be used in downward entailing contexts.",

Cross-linguistically, <em>wh</em>-words are commonly used not only for question-formation but also in a range of other constructions, including in <em>wh</em>-quantification, indefinites, and the formation of relative clauses. In Chuj, we will show that <em>wh</em>-words are used to form indefinites in certain limited environments, universal quantifiers, free choice items, and two kinds of free relatives &mdash; definite free relatives but also typologically rarer indefinite free relatives. We sketch an analysis of each construction, and discuss generalizations concerning their distribution. The varied uses of <em>wh</em>-words in Chuj supports the view that <em>wh</em>-words are used in two capacities: to generate alternatives, and to create a movement/binding relation.",

In this talk I present a slew of evidence for syntactic dependencies (movement chains) which exist simultaneously between the predicate and the target and between the predicate and the standard. Both the target and the standard are thus shown to be independently dependent on the predicate of comparison&mdash;a hypothesis I dub \"Independent Dependency.\"",

        "year": "2016",
        "abstract": "English is one of many languages in which relative clauses (RC) can be constructed using <em>wh</em>-words as <em>relative pronouns</em>. The relative pronoun originates lower in the clause and A-moves to the edge of the RC. This movement can <em>pied-pipe</em> other material with it, resulting in <em>relative pronoun pied-piping</em> (RPPP).\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the structure and interpretation of English <em>non-restrictive relative clauses</em>. We propose that in non-restrictive relatives, relative pronouns are interpreted <em>in-situ</em> within the pied-piped constituent at LF, using Rooth- Hamblin alternative computation (Hamblin, 1973; Rooth, 1985, 1992, a.o.). Evidence comes from the presence of <em>intervention effects</em> in RPPP; intervention effects (Beck, 2006; Sauerland & Heck, 2003, a.o.) can be used to diagnose regions of alternative computation (see Kotek & Erlewine, to appear; Erlewine & Kotek, 2014). The proposal here has the consequence that non-restrictive relatives are fundamentally <em>proposition-denoting</em> in contrast to restrictive relatives which are <em>property-denoting</em>.\n\n<strong>See also <a href=\"/research/rppp-sub.html\">Intervention effects in relative pronoun pied-piping: experimental evidence</a> in <em>SuB 20</em> for supporting experimental evidence.</strong>",

        "abstract": "In this paper I discuss the distribution of focus-sensitive adverbs in Vietnamese, which exhibits a Minimality effect. Given a fixed position for focus β, there may be different structural heights within a given phase where an adverb α associating with that focus β can adjoin. The focus-sensitive adverb α must appear in the position which minimizes the structural distance between it and its focus associate β. This translates into a requirement that focus-sensitive adverbs adjoin as low as possible, within a particular set of possible adjunction positions.\n\nMuch previous literature on Minimality has focused on whether or not such effects derive from transderivational competition, based primarily on Minimality effects on movement. I show that previous approaches to well-studied Minimality patterns which avoid transderivational competition do not extend to the pattern observed here. In contrast, we can develop a uniform treatment of Minimality effects if we adopt transderivational competition as in early Minimalist work such as Chomsky (1992).\n\n<strong>For also <a href=\"/research/vietnamese-only.html\">\"Vietnamese focus particles and derivation by phase”</a> in <em>JEAL</em>.

        "abstract": "Mandarin Chinese clausal syntax can be described as strictly head-initial, with the exception of certain &#8220;particles&#8221; which are linearized at the end of the clause. Previous work on these sentence-final particles (SFPs) has assumed that all SFPs are very high, in the CP periphery. In this paper I show that a subset of SFPs are in a lower, clause-medial position, based on the scopal interaction of these SFPs with negation, modals, quantificational subjects, and alternative question disjunction. I identify this position as coinciding with the edge of the lower phase, traditionally identified as <em>v</em>P.\n\nAs SFPs are head-final heads with head-initial complements, they have been discussed as an important apparent exception to the Final-over-Final Constraint (FOFC), a proposed universal on structure-building and linearization. The existence of exceptions to FOFC in a clause-medial position in addition to the CP edge motivates the view that FOFC holds only within individual Spell-Out domains.",

        "abstract": "In this paper I show that focus-sensitive adverbs in Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese are required to be as low as possible in their phase while c-commanding their focus associate. This generalization parallels what has been proposed under one approach to German focus-sensitive particles by Jacobs (1983, 1986) and Büring and Hartmann (2001) under the banner of &#8220;Closeness,&#8221; but these analyses have been controversial. This &#8216;&#8216;as low as possible&#8221; behavior must result from the comparison of competing derivations, which I model using Optimality Theory. The fact that this requirement only holds within each phase shows that transderivational competition must be evaluated cyclically at each phase (Heck and Müller, 2001; Fanselow and Ćavar, 2001), and more generally offers a new kind of evidence for the idea of phase-based cyclic Spell Out (Chomsky, 2000, 2001).\n\nIn Vietnamese, I study the &#8216;only&#8217; operator <em>chỉ</em>. Vietnamese has a morphologically rich inventory of focus-sensitive operators which makes it clear that <em>chỉ</em> is an adverb. In Mandarin Chinese, I study the focus marker <em>shì</em> and the &#8216;only&#8217; operator <em>zhǐyǒu/zhǐ</em>. I argue that in the synchronic grammar of Mandarin, despite surface appearances, <em>zhǐyǒu</em> is an allomorph of <em>zhǐ</em> and that both <em>shì</em> and <em>zhǐyǒu/zhǐ</em> are adverbs.\n\n<strong>I am no longer pursuing publication of this paper in this form. The Vietnamese portion of this paper, without the OT presentation, is in <a href=\"http://mitcho.com/research/vietnamese-only.html\">“Vietnamese focus particles and derivation by phase”</a> in <em>JEAL</em>. See <a href=\"https://mitcho.com/research/minimality-focus.html\">“Minimality and focus-sensitive adverb placement”</a> in the <em>Proceedings of NELS 45</em> for discussion of the OT formulation.</strong>",

Evidence for the proposal comes from the semantic scope of sentence-final <em>éryǐ</em> and <em>le</em> with respect to negation and modals.

However, I show that this c-command requirement is insufficient to capture the distribution of focus adverbs (e.g. <em>only</em>) in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese. I show that focus adverbs must be as low as possible while c-commanding their focus associate, within a particular extended vP domain. The generalization is similar to what has been described for German by Büring and Hartmann (2001), but without an explanation. I propose a syntax for focus adverbs which, together with the standard Roothian semantics of focus, derives this behavior.",

        "abstract": "In an Austronesian-type voice system, a single argument is designated the \"pivot\" in each clause, with verbal morphology indicating the choice of pivot and corresponding changes in case marking and extraction possibilities. It has been suggested that ergativity plays a crucial role in Austronesian-type voice systems. In this paper, we argue that voice marking and case reflect separate but interacting systems, which can be dissociated from each other, based on the behavior of voice in Dinka (Nilotic; South Sudan) and Balinese (Austronesian; Indonesia). These languages exhibit familiar voice morphology, but can clearly be shown to not involve any ergativity. Instead, we propose that what unifies &#8220;voice&#8221; system behavior is a lack of structural licensing for the subject in Non-Subject Voices. We show that different voice systems solve this problem in different ways: Balinese licenses the subject under adjacency with the verb, whereas Dinka allows for last resort assignment of genitive case like in many Austronesian languages of the Philippines and of Taiwan.\n\nInvited contribution.",

        "year": "2015",
        "abstract": "One of the major questions in Austronesian syntax concerns the relationship between voice marking, extraction, and case. Two common approaches have dominated previous literature. Either voice morphology marks extraction and case, or voice morphology feeds extraction and case. These positions are difficult to distinguish, because of the prominent one-to-one correspondence of voice, case, and extraction. In this paper, we bring new insights to this debate, with original data from Balinese and Dinka, a Nilotic language of South Sudan, which we show exhibits a familiar Austronesian-type voice system. We observe environments in these languages where the correspondence between voice and case and voice and extraction breaks down, in a manner that we argue provides evidence that <em>voice marks extraction</em>. Unlike in other extraction-marking languages, however, voice also affects case in Austronesian-type voice systems. We suggest that this is because extraction targets a case position. We account for the changes in case marking in the clause by suggesting that, when the external argument is not extracted, languages must employ alternative strategies to license it.",

I propose that <em>qu</em> is a marker on topics licensed in a particular structural position (Spec,TopicP). While the subject will normally be in this position, when it is not, another [+specific] DP can occupy this position and be <em>qu</em>-marked.

        "abstract": "The ability of English VP-<em>even</em> but not VP-<em>only</em> to associate with a leftward subject (Jackendoff, 1972) has been a long-standing puzzle for the theory of focus association, and runs counter to the generalization that focus-sensitive operators associate with a focused constituent in their scope. Here I argue that such backwards association is illusory. In cases of apparent leftward subject association, <em>even</em> is associating with the subject&#8217;s predicate-internal lower copy of movement, which is within the scope of <em>even</em>. The same configuration with <em>only</em> yields an uninterpretable structure, due to independent differences in the semantic contribution of <em>even</em> and <em>only</em>. I then show that this pattern of association extends to other cases of movement as well: in general, <em>even</em> but not <em>only</em> is able to associate with material which has moved out of the operator&#8217;s scope. Patterns of leftward focus association present a new argument against the scope theory of <em>even</em>.\n\n<strong>This represents a very short presentation of the core idea developed in <a href=\"http://mitcho.com/research/dissertation.html\">my dissertation</a>.</strong>",

        "abstract": "In many Mayan languages, A-bar extraction of subjects of transitive clauses triggers a change to that verb&#8217;s morphology, known as Agent Focus. Previous researchers have assumed an exceptionless correlation between AF and the A-bar extraction of a transitive subject. In this paper new data from Kaqchikel (Mayan, Guatemala) shows that AF is a response to A-bar movement of a transitive subject that is too short. Movement of a transitive subject does not trigger AF if the movement chain is made longer by adding intervening material. An anti-locality constraint is proposed: \"Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality,\" which bans movement between successive specifier positions. Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality explains the full distributional pattern of AF in Kaqchikel. \n\n<strong>For full discussion, see <a href=\"http://mitcho.com/research/af.html\">“Anti-locality and optimality in Kaqchikel Agent Focus”</a> in <em>NLLT</em>.</strong>",

        "abstract": "This dissertation investigates the consequences of overt and covert movement on association with focus. The interpretation of focus-sensitive operators such as &#8217;only&#8217; and &#8217;even&#8217; depends on the presence of a focused constituent in their scope. I document the complex conditions under which operators are able to associate with a focused constituent which has moved out of their scope. In particular, I concentrate on the ability of English &#8217;even&#8217; but not &#8217;only&#8217; to associate \"backwards\" in this configuration.\n\nI propose a theory based on the Copy Theory of movement which predicts the attested patterns of backwards association. When an operator gives the appearance of associating backwards, it is in fact associating with focus in the lower copy of the movement chain, within its scope. This is possible with &#8217;even&#8217; but not &#8217;only&#8217; due to independent differences in their compositional semantics: &#8217;only&#8217; uses focus alternatives to compute new truth conditions, whereas &#8217;even&#8217; uses the alternatives to introduce a presupposition without modifying the truth conditions. I furthermore argue that neither syntactic reconstruction nor covert movement of &#8217;even&#8217; (the scope theory) are adequate as a general solution to the problem of backwards association. This analysis supports a view where focus is represented in the narrow syntax and then interpreted at the interfaces.\n\nThe analysis is built upon a general framework for focus interpretation based on Kratzer (1991) which I apply to structures involving copy chains, combined with new facts regarding the projection behavior of the scalar inference of &#8217;even&#8217;. After presenting my proposal, I discuss its implications for the internal structure of DPs and show that it offers a new structural diagnostic for the derivational path of movement. Moreover, the inability of scope reconstruction to feed focus association in English motivates a new approach to syntactic reconstruction. The proposal developed here explains a range constraints on patterns of focus association, and more generally contributes to our understanding of the interaction of syntactic operations such as movement with the semantic and information-structural notion of focus.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new kind of semantic analysis for Japanese head-internal relative clauses (HIRCs), based on new empirical observations concerning the interpretation of HIRCs with quantificational heads. The analysis involves abstraction over the domain of the HIRC&#8217;s head quantifier via null operator movement. The entire HIRC is then interpreted as a definite description, using a maximal informativeness semantics for definiteness (von Fintel, Fox, and Iatridou 2012) and an assumption about the role of context in the interpretation of referential expressions. This analysis accounts for the new data, the island sensitivity of HIRCs, and the fact that quantificational heads take scope within the HIRC. Finally, previous analyses for the semantics of Japanese HIRC are discussed in relation to the new data presented. \n\n<strong>For full discussion, see <a href=\"https://mitcho.com/research/japanese-rc.html\">“Unifying Japanese relative clauses”</a> in <em>Glossa</em>.</strong>",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a previously unobserved pattern of morphological blocking in English causatives, which parallels a well-studied pattern of morphological blocking in Japanese causatives (Kuroda, 1965, a.o.). We present evidence of deep parallels between the English and Japanese causatives along with a detailed syntax/semantics for these structures within the framework of Distributed Morphology. We argue that the blocking effect is sensitive not to structural adjacency, as previously argued for Japanese (Harley, 2008), but instead to linear adjacency. Our findings constitute a strong argument for the post-syntactic resolution of derivational morphology, pace Distributed Morphology and contra the Lexicalist Hypothesis. In particular, the sensitivity to linear adjacency shows that the operations relevant to the blocking effect must occur post-linearization, and therefore contributes to our understanding of the timing of post-syntactic operations.",

In this paper I investigate the syntax of Agent Focus in Kaqchikel, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. I argue that this extraction asymmetry in Kaqchikel is the result of a particular anti-locality constraint which bans movement that is too close. Support for this claim comes from new data on the distribution of Agent Focus in Kaqchikel that show this locality-sensitivity.\n\nThe distribution and realization of Agent Focus will then be modeled using a system of ranked, violable constraints operating over competing derivations. This theoretical choice will be supported by details in the pattern of agreement in Agent Focus. I will then show how rerankings of the proposed constraints can model the attested distribution of Agent Focus in a number of other Mayan languages. I also discuss extensions of this approach to other patterns of anti-agreement.",

Beck, Oda, and Sugisaki (2004) propose that languages may vary in whether or not they allow for abstraction over degree variables through movement. In previous work, comparatives with clausal standards have been uniformly analyzed cross-linguistically as involving A-movement of a degree operator, and are thereby predicted to not occur in languages without degree abstraction. The paper shows that clausal comparison without degree abstraction is not only theoretically possible but attested, contributing to the cross-linguistic typology of degree constructions. Along the way, I detail the syntactic derivation of bǐ comparatives and the obligatory ellipsis operation (comparative deletion) in their derivation.",

        "abstract": "More and more researchers in linguistics use large-scale experiments to test hypotheses about the data they research, in addition to more traditional informant work. In this paper we describe a new set of free, open-source tools that allow linguists with little background in programming or experimental methods to post studies online. These tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. Our tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data. Surveys created using the tools described in this paper can be posted on Amazon.com&#8217;s Mechanical Turk, a popular crowdsourcing platform which mediates between &#8216;Requesters&#8217; who can post surveys online and &#8216;Workers&#8217; who complete them. This allows many linguistic surveys to be completed within hours or days and at low costs of $50 or less. Alternatively, researchers can host these randomized experiments on their own servers using a supplied server-side component.",

The evidence will come from an interaction between the interpretation of pied-piped constituents with focus intervention effects (Beck 2006).",

        "abstract": "In this paper we argue for the existence of covert pied-piping in wh-questions through a previously unnoticed pattern of intervention effects in superiority-obeying English multiple wh-questions. We show that the preference of covert pied-piping is for movement of larger constituents, unlike overt pied-piping. We argue that this discrepancy stems from conflicting requirements of PF and LF: overt pied-piping feeds both LF and PF, but covert pied-piping feeds LF only. The study of covert pied-piping thus reveals the true preference of LF and Core Syntax with regard to pied-piping: larger pied-piping constituents are preferred over smaller ones. This preference can be overridden by certain PF constraints that apply to overt pied-piping.",

        "abstract": "A common property of many Mayan languages is a change to transitive verb morphology when the subject has been extracted, known as Agent Focus (AF) (Aissen, 1999; Stiebels, 2006; Norcliffe, 2009; Coon et al., 2011, a.o.). AF is traditionally described as obligatory whenever the subject (ergative argument) is A&#8217;-extracted. In this paper I will discuss the morphological realization of AF in Kaqchikel. I argue that the realization of AF in Kaqchikel must be governed by a morphological process which is independent of the syntax of AF. Specifically, I argue that AF morphology is the realization of an abstract [AF] feature which spreads downwards within a certain domain, following Bjorkman&#8217;s (ms) feature-spreading approach to Affix Hopping-type verbal morphology.",

        "abstract": "While the syntax of wh-in-situ in Mandarin Chinese has been central to discussions of the linguistic theory of covert movement (Huang, 1982), little attention has been paid to the syntax and semantics of alternative questions in Mandarin. I argue that alternative-question-triggering disjunctions in Mandarin are interpreted <em>in-situ</em> at LF using a process of alternative computation, supported by evidence from island sensitivity and focus intervention effects. I offer a proposal for the different semantics of alternative-question-triggering disjunction (<em>háishì</em>) and logical disjunction (<em>hùozhe</em>), in languages such as Mandarin which lexicalize this difference, and show that it can explain the distribution of question &#8220;force&#8221; in Mandarin clauses involving disjunction.\n\n<strong>Superseded by <a href=\"/research/haishi.html\">“Two disjunctions in Mandarin Chinese”</a></strong>\n",

Instead, I propose that the derivation of a <em>bǐ</em> comparative involves the construction of two full TPs: one for the target and one for the standard. This view is motivated by comparatives where material has moved simultaneously from the predicate into the target and into the standard, which are difficult to capture within a Direct Analysis. A technical implementation of this proposal is presented in which common material in the two TPs&#8217; predicates is obligatorily multidominated. \n\n<strong>For full discussion, see <a href=\"https://mitcho.com/research/bi.html\">“Clausal comparison without degree abstraction in Mandarin Chinese”</a> in <em>NLLT</em>.</strong>",

Following work on Chinese Sentence-Final Particles (SFP), <em>éryǐ</em> syntactically is in the CP-domain and thus should scope above TP-level operators such as negation, and this is indeed normally the case. However, the introduction of the focus marker <em>shì</em> can force the sentence-final <em>éryǐ</em> to take scope below the TP-level negation, creating a problem for the theory of Mandarin SFP.\n\nI propose that <em>shì</em> unambiguously marks the semantic scope of Mandarin focus-sensitive operators which involve Association With Focus. I show how this analysis preserves the expected syntactic cartography while computing the correct semantic scope. A compositional syntax/semantics utilizing focus movement is also presented.\n\n<strong>This analysis is superseded by that in <a href=\"https://mitcho.com/research/sfp-fofc.html\">“Low sentence-final particles in Mandarin Chinese and the Final-over-Final Constraint”</a> in <em>JEAL</strong></em>",
