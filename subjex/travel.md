## Reminder

Please keep your boarding passes and bring them to the workshop!

## Entering Singapore

You can enter Singapore as a tourist. You can say you are visiting a friend (me) who works at NUS. If they have any questions, or you have any trouble, my cell is (+65)81625167. (65 is our country code.)

You will be staying in the serviced apartments at Kent Vale, which is on campus faculty housing. The address is: **121 Clementi Road**, Singapore 129802

## Getting to Kent Vale

Kent Vale is located slightly west of the center of town, whereas the airport is at the far east of the island. You can get to Kent Vale from the airport (or from the center of town) by public transport or taxi.

**If you arrive on Wednesday:** Remember that August 9 is National Day, so depending on the time, public transit may be surprisingly crowded or you may have difficulty getting cabs. Hopefully not, but just a warning.

### By public transit:

Buy an EZ Link card (stored value card) and put some money on it. There's like a $5 deposit. From the airport to Kent Vale should be **under $3** using an EZ Link card, and take an hour to an hour and a half.

Take the **East West line (green) to Clementi station**. Go to the bus interchange --- it's on the ground floor of the Clementi Mall attached to the station. Take the **96** bus, which only goes one direction from Clementi:

Get off at the NUS Faculty of Engineering bus stop, the fourth stop. Walk to the closest intersection with a stoplight, and you'll see where to enter Kent Vale.

Later if you go from Kent Vale to Clementi MRT, you want to wait for the **183** right outside Kent Vale at the Japanese Primary School bus stop.

### By taxi:

A cab from the airport to Kent Vale should be maybe **$25--30**. You can give them the address, 121 Clementi Road. **Warning:** There are some cabs ("Limo cabs"?) that are more expensive than normal cars --- avoid! If you hope to pay by credit card, you should also check that the driver can take credit cards before you get in.

If you are comfortable using Uber, they have some deal where you can call an UberPool (where they group you in a car together with other people) from the airport to anywhere in Singapore for $10, and then you choose which terminal you're in and they tell you which door to go to.

## Checking in

Check-in at Kent Vale is open 24 hours. When you arrive at the "arrival plaza" (the roundabout right behind the guard house) you can turn right and the front desk will be the first building on your left.

Your room should have wireless internet. There is a breakfast that is offered for visitors. Each room allows for two persons' access to breakfast.

## To the workshop venue

The workshop is in building ("block") **AS7**, sixth floor, room 06-42. This is a 10--15 minute walk from Kent Vale:

There is also a campus-internal shuttle bus (**BTC1**) which you could take from Kent Vale. This shuttle bus stop is right by the guard house, in front of the Cold Storage. There's a sign with the schedule there. Take the BTC1 bus to the Kent Ridge Drive stop, which is right in front of the AS7 building:

(Unfortunately there's not a great shuttle bus option back from the workshop to Kent Vale.)
