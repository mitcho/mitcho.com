title: Syntax/semantics reading group at NUS

The syntax/semantics reading group at NUS meets weekly during the semester. Each week we choose a paper to read and discuss, or someone will share their work in progress.

## Announcements

Announcements are sent to the `synsem` mailing list. Subscribe to `synsem` on [NUS Groups](https://groups.nus.edu.sg/NUSgroups/).

## 2017--2018 Sem 1

We will meet **Thursdays at 11am**, in the AS5 fifth floor reading room. (Syn/sem talks in the department seminar series are also included, in bold.)
