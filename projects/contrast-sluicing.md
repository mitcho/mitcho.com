[**Teruyuki Mizuno**](https://teruyukimizuno.wordpress.com/) and I investigate constraints on *contrast sluicing* in Japanese and English, as in examples such as \"I know which *book* John read, but not which *magazine*,\" which has been relatively understudied in the literature on sluicing. For the first time, we discuss contrast sluicing between multiple *wh* question antecedent and slucing clauses, and observe a curious pattern of grammaticality in Japanese. This pattern constitutes a puzzle for the LF syntax of sluicing and/or pair-list multiple *wh* questions.
