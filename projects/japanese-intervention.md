Certain quantiﬁcational elements ("interveners") have long been known to disrupt the interpretation of *wh*-in-situ (Hoji 1985 and many others), but the correct description of the set of interveners and the nature of such **intervention eﬀects** have been the subject of continued debate. [**Hadas Kotek**](//hkotek.com) and I observe a new generalization concerning the nature of intervener-hood in Japanese: A quantiﬁer acts as an intervener if and only if it is scope-rigid. This supports the view that intervention reflects a restriction on the relative positions of interveners and *wh* at LF (Beck 2006 a.o.) but leads further to the surprising conclusion that *any* quantifier interpreted in a derived position leads to intervention. This in turn supports Hadas Kotek's recent theory of intervention effects, independently motivated based on a close study of English *wh*-questions.
