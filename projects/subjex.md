A'-extraction of subjects is cross-linguistically marked, requiring a difference in complementizer or verbal morphology. I put forward the hypothesis that many such quirks of subject extraction result from an **anti-locality constraint on A'-movement** which blocks movement which is *too short*; specifically, subject movement from Spec,TP to Spec,CP is blocked, necessitating the use of an additional strategy for subject extraction.

This view is motivated by my work on **Agent Focus in Kaqchikel** (Mayan; Guatemala). Kaqchikel is a morphologically ergative Mayan language where the A'-extraction of subjects of transitives (ergative arguments) requires special verbal morphology, known as *Agent Focus* (AF). Through my fieldwork on Kaqchikel, I discovered cases where the extraction of an ergative subject does *not* require AF. In particular, when additional clausal material is projected between the base position of the ergative subject and its landing site, AF becomes unnecessary and in fact impossible. I propose an anti-locality-based solution in my *Natural Language & Linguistic Theory* paper, which also accounts for the distribution of AF in certain person agreement combinations.

I am currently pursuing this anti-locality approach to a range of subjext extraction asymmetries, including **anti-agreement** effects, **complementizer-trace** (*that*-trace) effects, and **Highest Subject Restrictions** on resumption.

In 2017, I hosted a [Workshop on Quirks of Subject Extraction](/subjex/), which brought together a group of established and emerging experts on the cross-linguistic landscape of subject extraction asymmetries, their theory, and implications. I myself presented my anti-locality work there. Following the workshop, I will be editing a [**special issue of *Glossa* on Subject Extraction**](https://www.glossa-journal.org/collections/special/subject-extraction/).
