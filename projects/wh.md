Aside from their canonical interrogative use, *wh*-words are used in many languages to build a range of quantificational expressions. What syntactic and semantic strategies are employed to quantify over the alternatives introduced by *wh*-words? To answer this question, I have investigated a number of non-interrogative *wh*-constructions --- often with [**Hadas Kotek**](http://hkotek.com) --- in Toba Batak (Austronesian), Chuj (Mayan), Tibetan, Burmese, and English.

In many languages, quantificational meanings are formed by combining a *wh*-word with an additional morpheme, **which is often a scalar focus particle or disjunctor** (see e.g. Haspelmath 1997: 157). I am currently developing **a framework for the compositional semantics of *wh*-quantification** in the two-dimensional Alternative Semantics framework of Rooth (1985, 1992) which models various attested forms of *wh*-quantification, and helps us explain the prevalent use of disjunctors and focus particles in *wh*-quantification.

A cross-linguistically common pattern of *wh*-quantification is ***wh*-even NPIs in Tibetan.** Hadas Kotek and I present a new compositional syntax/semantics for *wh*-even NPIs, improving upon previous analyses such as Ramchand (1996), with implications for the analysis of 'even.' Our analysis uses **both the scalar and additive meanings** introduced by 'even,' and crucially computes these two meanings with different scopes. I am exploring an extention of this account to the behavior of *wh*-even NPIs in Japanese and other languages.

In recent work in progress, I have investigated the Tibetan particle *yin.n'ang* which has three uses: (a) as a **counterexpectational** discourse particle (like English 'but' or 'however'), (b) as a **scalar concessive particle**, and (c) to form ***wh*-free choice items**. Morphologically, *yin.n'ang* is transparently the combination of a copular verb, conditional ending, and scalar particle (e.g. 'even'). I develop a compositional semantics for three functions from these ingredients, and also advocate for the extension of this approach to Japanese *demo* and similar particles in Dravidian languages, which have similar distributions and morphological makeup.

An example of a more complex particle involved with *wh*-quantification is *manang* in Toba Batak, which is a **disjunctor** but also **forms *wh*-NPIs and *wh*-free choice items**. I propose that *manang* is the spellout of maximally two logical operators: **J**, which collects the ordinary semantic values of disjuncts into a set of alternatives, and **∃**, which creates an existential quantifier from a set of alternatives. In the Alternative Semantics framework, I derive the different disjunctive and *wh*-quantifying uses of *manang* and various constraints on their interpretation. I additionally report on the use of *manang* in embedded questions.

Hadas Kotek and I have investigated **bare *wh*-indefinites and free relatives in Chuj**, an understudied Mayan language of Guatemala. We show that **indefinite free relatives in Chuj are equivalent in size to definite free relatives**, as proposed by Caponigro (2003), contrary to a conjecture by Šimík (2011) that indefinite free relatives are always reduced clauses. We have also contributed a survey of non-interrogative uses of *wh*-words in the language.

In other work, Hadas and I have investigated the syntax and semantics of ***wh*-words used as relative pronouns**. Using [the intervention effect diagnostics which we pioneered](/projects/piedpiping), we show that relative pronouns in English non-restrictive relatives are interpreted in-situ within their pied-piping constituents via focus alternative computation. We show that this supports the view that **non-restrictive relatives are proposition-denoting**, rather than property-denoting.
