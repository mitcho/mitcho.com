Focus particles such as *only*, *even*, and *also* relate the current utterance to other alternatives in the discourse. While particles with these three, well-studied functions are common in language of the world, their precise semantics can vary, and languages also have particles which express different meanings, or meanings which cross-cut these common categories. My own work has studied unique focus particles in Burmese and Tibetan.

My student Keely New and I have investigated **the Burmese focus particle *hma***, which expresses exhaustivity in some contexts but a scalar, *even*-like meaning in other contexts. We propose that *hma* is uniformly a not-at-issue scalar exhaustive, and derive these two uses through a scope ambiguity with respect to negation. We also analyze the relationship between *hma* and the sentence-final mood marker *dar* as an instance of **pragmatic focus concord**, best explained through the interaction of these particles' independent semantics, rather than the result of morphosyntactic agreement.

In recent work, I have studied **the Tibetan particle *yin.na'ang***. *Yin.na'ang* has three uses: (a) as a counterexpectational discourse particle (like English 'but' or 'however'), (b) as a scalar concessive particle, and (c) to form free choice items with *wh*-words. Morphologically, *yin.na'ang* is transparently the combination of a copular verb, conditional ending, and scalar particle (e.g. 'even'). I develop a compositional semantics for three functions from these ingredients, and also advocate for the extension of this approach to **Japanese *demo*** which has a similar distribution and (historical) morphological makeup.

I am also interested in the cross-linguistic syntax and semantics of *clefts* and, more generally, grammatical markers which make reference to the Question Under Discussion (QUD). This interest stems from my investigation of **the Mandarin Chinese focus marker *shì* 是**, which I argue expresses **cleft semantics without a \"cleaving\" syntax** which separates the focused pivot from its background, as an English *it*-cleft does. I show that *shì* requires the material in its scope to be congruent to an accepted QUD, supporting the view that **cleft semantics is QUD-dependent** (Velleman et al 2012), unlike other exclusives such as *only*. I also investigate the syntax and semantics of **\"cleft questions,\"** such as the English *Who is it that came last night?*, which seem to be an instance of backwards focus association as investigated in [my dissertation](/research/dissertation.html).
