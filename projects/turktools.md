In joint work with [**Hadas Kotek**](//hkotek.com), I developed [turktools](//turktools.net), a set of **free, open-source tools** that allow linguists with little background in programming **to post linguistic surveys online**, for example on Amazon's [Mechanical Turk](//mturk.com) crowdsourcing platform. Hadas Kotek and I taught a workshop series on the design of online experiments and the use of these tools at MIT.
