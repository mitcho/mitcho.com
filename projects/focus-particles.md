I am currently studying the structural placement of focus particles, in particular **sentential 'only' words in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese.** I observe that in languages that allow sentential focus particles at different attachment heights on the clausal spine, there is a generalization that **a focus particle must be *as low as possible* while c-commanding its associate, within a given phase**. Jacobs (1983) and BÃ¼ring & Hartmann (2001) describe the distribution of German focus adverbs in similar terms, but its cross-linguistic generality has not been explored and the nature of this "as low as possible" description has not been adequately studied. The sensitivity of this behavior to phase boundaries forms a new argument for the theory of phase-based, cyclic structure-building.
