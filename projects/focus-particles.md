I have studied the structural placement of focus particles, in particular **sentential 'only' words in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese.** I observe that in languages that allow sentential focus particles at different attachment heights on the clausal spine, there is a generalization that **a focus particle must be *as low as possible* while c-commanding its associate, within a given phase**. Jacobs (1983) and BÃ¼ring & Hartmann (2001) describe the distribution of German focus adverbs in similar terms, but its cross-linguistic generality has not been explored and the nature of this "as low as possible" description has not been adequately studied. The sensitivity of this behavior to phase boundaries forms a new argument for the theory of phase-based, cyclic structure-building.

The semantics of focus particles requires that they take their associating focus in their scope --- a conclusion reinforced by the findings of [my dissertation](/research/dissertation.html). And yet, there are apparent exceptions to this generalization. A particularly challenging class of such exceptions is **where the focus particle is contained within its logical focus associate**, a configuration which [Kenyon Branan](https://sites.google.com/view/kbranan/home) and I call **anti-pied-piping**. We document instances of anti-pied-piping in over 20 languages and show that anti-pied-piping affects both focus particle placement and focus movement, and cannot be the result of a purely post-syntactic operation. We propose a theory of focus particles as late adjoined during cyclic Spell-Out --- and focus movement parasitic on particle placement, following Cable's Q theory --- which unifies anti-pied-piping with better-studied pied-piping behavior.
