Under the influential Roothian proposal for focus association, focused phrases remain in-situ at LF (Rooth, 1985, 1992). However, a recent line of work has resurrected the idea that **focus association involves covert movement**: specifically, the associate of English sentential only must covertly move to only (Drubig, 1994; Krifka, 1996, 2006; Tancredi, 1997, 2004; Wagner, 2006). **[Hadas Kotek](http://hkotek.com)** and I have developed new arguments for this idea that **association with English sentential *only* involves covert focus movement, with the possibility of pied-piping**. We show that covert pied-piping in focus association explains previously unnoticed patterns of island-sensitivity in *Tanglewood* constructions (Kratzer, 1991) as well as patterns of focus intervention effects in focus constructions. We also show that covert focus movement can feed reflexive binding and parasitic gap licensing.
