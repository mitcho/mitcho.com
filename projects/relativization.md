[**Isaac Gould**](//linguistics.ku.edu/isaac-gould) and I have investigated the structure and interpretation of **head-internal relative clauses in Japanese** and their lesser-studied doubly-headed variants. We present new evidence that these relatives are best analyzed as definite descriptions, rather than through E-type anaphora, and present an analysis that accounts for their readings in different contexts. In our most recent work, we propose a novel **DP head-raising derivation** for relative clauses that takes advantage of the Copy Theory of movement and the late-merger of relative clauses. This allows for the unification of head-internal and doubly-headed relativization strategies with the familiar head-external form, which would otherwise not be possible.

More recently, I have investigated the derivation of **Tibetan relative clauses** and the functions of the "nominalizer" morphemes involved. Previous work on Tibetan such as DeLancey 1999 describe different "nominalizer" morphemes used for the relativization of subjects, locative/goals, instruments, and themes. New data from long-distance relatives shows that **so-called "nominalizers" are comprised of two distinct classes of morphemes**: the historically oldest marker, *-pa*, always appears at the edge of the entire relative clause, whereas the other morphemes reflect a particular type of local extraction. I also argue that relativization cannot be reduced to nominalization, contrary to previous descriptions.

Relativization in many languages is subject to extraction restrictions. [**Kenyon Branan**](https://sites.google.com/view/kbranan/home) and I argue that **A'-probing that is restricted to the closest DP** underlies many apparent subject-only restrictions on relativization, including many in the Keenan & Comrie survey of relativization strategies as well as in Turkish and Rejang (Indonesia).
