One of my earliest areas of interest is the syntax/semantics of degree constructions such as comparatives, inspired by my undergraduate advisor [Chris Kennedy](https://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/).

Previous work on the syntax/semantics of comparatives with clausal standards proposes the use of A'-movement of a degree operator in the standard, following early work on English comparatives (Bresnan, 1973; Chomsky, 1977). In my most recent work on the subject, I argue that the **Mandarin Chinese *bǐ* 比 comparative** is a comparative with **a clausal standard that is not derived through degree abstraction**. Crucial evidence comes from movement and ellipsis which shows that the standard in the Mandarin *bǐ* comparative is indeed clausal, despite surface appearances.

More recently, Anne Nguyen and I have investigated the syntax/semantics of **degree constructions in Vietnamese**, concentrating on the uses of the morpheme *quá*. *Quá* is used to form excessive constructions, akin to English *too*, but stands alone in the language in being able to both precede and follow its gradable predicate. We show that **pre-predicate and post-predicate versions of *quá* convey the meaning of excess in different ways:** the latter relates the target degree to a purpose-oriented threshold, similar to well-studied excessives in other languages (Meier 2003, Schwarzschild 2008), whereas the latter is a comparative that introduces a not-at-issue malefactive inference. The study of *quá* as an excessive is however complicated by various other uses of the morpheme in the language, which our work also serves to disentangle.
