Previous work on the syntax/semantics of comparatives with clausal standards proposes the use of A'-movement of a degree operator in the standard, following early work on English comparatives (Bresnan, 1973; Chomsky, 1977). I argue that the **Mandarin Chinese *bǐ* 比 comparative** is a comparative with **a clausal standard that is not derived through degree abstraction**. Crucial evidence comes from movement and ellipsis which shows that the standard in the Mandarin *bǐ* comparative is indeed clausal, despite surface appearances. My work on this subject began with my MA thesis advised by [Chris Kennedy](https://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/).

More recently, Anne Nguyen and I have investigated the syntax/semantics of **degree constructions in Vietnamese**. Degree morphemes in Vietnamese may precede or follow their gradable predicate: e.g. *rất* ‘very’ precedes, *nhất* ‘most’ follows. We argue that these two classes of expressions differ significantly in their syntax and semantics: **Pre-predicate degree morphemes are functional heads whereas post-predicate degree morphemes head phrasal modifiers.** The latter denote degree quantifiers which must **move overtly to the right** to take scope, deriving their post-predicate word order.

We have also looked specifically at the degree morpheme *quá*, which forms excessive constructions, akin to English *too*. *Quá* is one of the few degree morphemes which can both precede and follow its predicate. We show that **pre-predicate and post-predicate versions of *quá* convey the meaning of excess in different ways:** the latter relates the target degree to a purpose-oriented threshold, similar to well-studied excessives in other languages (Meier 2003, Schwarzschild 2008), whereas the latter is a comparative that introduces a not-at-issue malefactive inference. The study of *quá* as an excessive is however complicated by various other uses of the morpheme in the language, which our work also serves to disentangle.
