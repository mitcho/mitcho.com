## Hello!

I am a linguist broadly interested in the structure of sentences (syntax) and how these structures map to meaning (semantics). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Linguistics][1] at [McGill University][2]. In a previous life, I was an active coder in the [Mozilla (Firefox)][3] and [WordPress][4] open-source communities.

## Areas of interest

*   syntax and semantics of focus and movement
*   the syntax of case, agreement, and movement
*   internet corpora and experiments

In previous work I have worked on: Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese, Kaqchikel (Mayan; Guatemala), Squliq Atayal (Austronesian; Taiwan).

See the [Research][5] page for descriptions of projects and downloadable papers.

## Teaching

*   Fall 2014: Research seminar [&#8220;Questions, focus, and friends&#8221;][6] with [Hadas Kotek][7]

## Recent

*   My dissertation: [*Movement Out of Focus*][8]
*   I presented [&#8220;On the position of focus adverbs&#8221;][9] at [Theoretical East Asian Linguistics][10] (TEAL 9) at the University of Nantes and at [NELS 45][11] at MIT.
*   [&#8220;What makes a voice system? On the relationship between voice marking and case&#8221;][12] with [Theodore Levin][13] and [Coppe van Urk][14] will appear in the Proceedings of [AFLA 21][15].
*   [&#8220;Anti-locality and optimality in Kaqchikel Agent Focus&#8221;][16] has been accepted for publication (pending minor revisions) in [*Natural Language & Linguistic Theory*][17]!

## Upcoming

*   January 2015: I will be at the LSA, presenting a poster &#8220;On the position of focus adverbs&#8221; and also a joint poster with [Theodore Levin][13] and [Coppe van Urk][14], &#8220;Voice morphology as extraction marking.&#8221; I will also present &#8220;Restructuring and Agent Focus in Kaqchikel&#8221; at the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA), colocated with the LSA.
*   March 2015: I will present &#8220;Focus economy and the closeness condition on focus adverbs&#8221; at the DGfS workshop [&#8220;What drives syntactic computation? Alternatives to formal features&#8221;][18].
