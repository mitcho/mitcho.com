## Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor in **Linguistics** at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg) ([Department of English Language & Literature](http://fas.nus.edu.sg/ell/)). I study the structure of sentences (**syntax**) and how these structures map to meaning (**semantics**). Much of my work is based on **fieldwork** on understudied and endangered languages. I received my Ph.D. from [MIT Linguistics](http://linguistics.mit.edu/) in 2014. In a previous life, I was active in the [Mozilla (Firefox)](http://mozilla.org) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) open-source communities.

## Areas of interest

*   syntax and semantics of focus, movement, and scope-taking
*	Alternative Semantics: focus, *wh*, questions, disjunction
*   the syntax of movement, case, and agreement

My work has investigated: Mandarin Chinese; English; Japanese; Austronesian: Toba Batak (Indonesia) and Squliq Atayal (Taiwan); Mayan: Kaqchikel and Chuj (Guatemala); Tibetan; Vietnamese...

See the [Projects](/projects) page for descriptions of projects and downloadable papers.
