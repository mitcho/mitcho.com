## Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor (Presidential Young Professor) in **Linguistics** at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg) ([Department of English, Linguistics, and Theater Studies](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/)). I received my Ph.D. from [MIT Linguistics](http://linguistics.mit.edu/) in 2014. [**My lab**](/lab) investigates the structure of sentences (**syntax**) and how these structures map to meaning (**semantics**). Much of our work is based on **fieldwork** on understudied languages, especially of **Southeast Asia**. I serve as Associate Editor at [*Glossa*](https://www.glossa-journal.org/) and on the Editorial Boards of [*Natural Language & Linguistic Theory*](https://www.springer.com/journal/11049) and [*Journal of East Asian Linguistics*](https://www.springer.com/journal/10831).

## Areas of interest

*   Movement: (anti-)locality, (anti-)pied-piping, extraction restrictions, interactions with case and agreement, the interpretation of movement chains
*   Alternatives: focus, focus particles, questions, *wh*-quantification, disjunction, discourse organization (QUDs), implicature calculation

My work has investigated:
* Austronesian: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Toba Batak' query='Toba Batak' %}, 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Rejang' query='Rejang' %} (Indonesia), 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Bikol' query='Bikol' %}, 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Pangasinan' query='Pangasinan' %} (Philippines), and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Squliq Atayal' query='Atayal' %} (Taiwan);
* Tibeto-Burman: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Tibetan' query='Tibetan' %} and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Burmese' query='Burmese' %};
* Mayan: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Kaqchikel' query='Kaqchikel' %} and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Chuj' query='Chuj' %} (Guatemala);
* {% include sitesearch.html text='Mandarin Chinese' query='Mandarin Chinese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='English' query='English' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Japanese' query='Japanese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Vietnamese' query='Vietnamese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Singlish' query='Singlish' %}...
