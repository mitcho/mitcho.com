## Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor (Presidential Young Professor) in **Linguistics** at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg) ([Department of English Language & Literature](http://fas.nus.edu.sg/ell/)). I received my Ph.D. from [MIT Linguistics](http://linguistics.mit.edu/) in 2014. [**My lab**](/lab) investigates the structure of sentences (**syntax**) and how these structures map to meaning (**semantics**). Much of our work is based on **fieldwork** on understudied languages, especially of Southeast Asia. I serve as Associate Editor at [*Glossa*](https://www.glossa-journal.org/) and on the Editorial Boards of [*Natural Language & Linguistic Theory*](https://www.springer.com/journal/11049) and [*Journal of East Asian Linguistics*](https://www.springer.com/journal/10831).

## Areas of interest

*   syntax and semantics of focus, movement, and scope-taking
*   Alternative Semantics: focus, questions, *wh*-quantification, disjunction, discourse structure
*   the syntax of movement, case, and agreement

My work has investigated:
* Austronesian: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Toba Batak' query='Toba Batak' %} (Indonesia), 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Bikol' query='Bikol' %}, 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Pangasinan' query='Pangasinan' %} (Philippines), and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Squliq Atayal' query='Atayal' %} (Taiwan);
* Tibeto-Burman: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Tibetan' query='Tibetan' %} and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Burmese' query='Burmese' %};
* Mayan: 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Kaqchikel' query='Kaqchikel' %} and 
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Chuj' query='Chuj' %} (Guatemala);
* {% include sitesearch.html text='Mandarin Chinese' query='Mandarin Chinese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='English' query='English' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Japanese' query='Japanese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Vietnamese' query='Vietnamese' %};
	{% include sitesearch.html text='Singlish' query='Singlish' %}...
