This past Monday I presented at [Tokyo 2.0][1], Japan&#8217;s largest bilingual web/tech community. I presented as part of a session on The Web and Language, which I also helped organize. Other presenters included Junji Tomita from [goo Labs][2], Shinjyou Sunao of [Knowledge Creation][3], developers of the [Voice Delivery System][4] API, and [Chris Salzberg][5] of [Global Voices Online][6] on community translation.

I just put together a video of my Ubiquity presentation, mixing [the audio recorded live][7] at the presentation together with a screencast of my slides for better visibility. The presentation is 10 minutes long and is bilingual, English and Japanese.

  
[Ubiquity: Command the Web with Language 言葉で操作する Web][8] from [mitcho][9] on [Vimeo][10].

<!--more--> The event also coincided with 

[Dave McClure&#8217;s][11] [Geeks on a Plane][12] Asia tour, attracting even more interest to the event. In the end it was the largest Tokyo 2.0 event ever.

As I [leave Tokyo next month][13], I&#8217;ll be sad to not be able to continue to be a part of Tokyo 2.0. I&#8217;ve met a lot of fascinating people and learned a lot at the monthly events. I&#8217;ll definitely make sure to schedule them in in my future travels back to Japan and I highly recommend any of you who travel to Tokyo do so as well.
