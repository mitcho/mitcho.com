I uploaded [Ubiquity][1] to [BabelZilla][2], an online community and tool for localizing Mozilla-style strings, just a couple days ago and we already have French and Polish complete.[^2] WOW!

<a href="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/babelzilla-status.png" rel='lightbox'><img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/babelzilla-status.png" alt="babelzilla-status.png" border="0" width="492" height="210" /></a>

Granted, these are only Ubiquity&#8217;s interface strings (for example, the about and settings pages)&#8230; the [parser localization][3] and [command localization][4] have their own processes.[^1] But this is still a tremendous accomplishment!

Hopefully we can roll some of these complete or almost-complete interface localizations with [Ubiquity 0.5.4][5] which is a minor bugfix update coming soon. **If you would like to get involved with localizing the Ubiquity interface strings into your language, get a BabelZilla login and sign up on [the Ubiquity project page][6].** Thanks again to our rockin&#8217; localizers!

    I received notification that the Polish localization in particular has completed testing and is now ready for release, *as I was writing this blog post*.

    Perhaps this anecdote is telling us that having a nice centralized web interface for localizers to work together and without messing with the files directly is a plus. Perhaps we should put up the builtin commands for localization on something like [[Pootle]] or [Launchpad][7]. Thoughts, anyone?
