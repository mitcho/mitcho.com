I just saw this logo near Yilan station and felt like I&#8217;ve seen it before&#8230;

![Obama for Taiwan 2008][1]

Oh my god, it&#8217;s [Obama][2]! The banner is actually for the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] party, one of the third-parties here in Taiwan (but it&#8217;s part of the [[Pan-Green Coalition]]).
