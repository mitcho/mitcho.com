## Travel tips

[Some general Singapore travel info](https://glowlinguistics.org/asia11/essentials/) from my GLOW in Asia website

## Boarding passes

Please keep your boarding passes and bring them to the workshop!

## Entering Singapore

You can enter Singapore as a tourist. You can say you are visiting a friend (me) who works at NUS. If they have any questions, or you have any trouble, my cell is (+65)81625167. (65 is our country code.)

You will be staying in the serviced apartments at Kent Vale, which is on campus faculty housing. The address is: **121 Clementi Road**, Singapore 129802

## Getting to Kent Vale

Kent Vale is located slightly west of the center of town, whereas the airport is at the far east of the island. You can get to Kent Vale from the airport (or from the center of town) by public transport or taxi.

### By public transit:

Go down to the MRT (metro) station and buy an EZ Link card (public transit stored value card) and put some money on it. There's like a $5 deposit. From the airport to Kent Vale should be **under $3** using an EZ Link card, but takes a little over an hour.

Take the **East West line (green) to Clementi station**. Go to the bus interchange --- it's on the ground floor of the Clementi Mall attached to the station. Take the **96** bus, which only goes one direction from Clementi:

Get off at the NUS Faculty of Engineering bus stop, the fourth stop. Walk to the closest intersection with a stoplight, and you'll see where to enter Kent Vale.

Later if you go from Kent Vale to Clementi MRT, you want to wait for the **183** right outside Kent Vale at the Japanese Primary School bus stop.

### By taxi:

A cab from the airport to Kent Vale should be maybe **$25--30**. You can give them the address, 121 Clementi Road. **Warning:** There are some cabs ("Limo cabs"?) that are more expensive than normal cars --- avoid! If you hope to pay by credit card, you should also check that the driver can take credit cards before you get in.

There is no Uber in Singapore, but there is [Grab](http://grab.com/) --- which you all probably know.

## Checking in

Check-in at Kent Vale is open 24 hours. When you arrive at the "arrival plaza" (the roundabout right behind the guard house) you can turn right and the front desk will be the first building on your left.

Your room should have wireless internet. There is a breakfast that is offered for visitors, 7am--10am.

## Saturday morning

We'll meet at the Kent Vale arrival plaza at 9:30am and walk together from there.
