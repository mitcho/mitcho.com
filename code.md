In a past life, I was a coder most active in the WordPress and Mozilla (Firefox) spaces. I have now essentially retired from professional coding to focus on my [academic work][1], but still maintain personal connections with these communities. From time to time I also consult and advise startups on language technology issues. You can find some of my most recent (primarily academic and hobby) projects [on GitHub][2].

My most popular open-source project was the [Yet Another Related Posts Plugin][3] for WordPress. I was also behind a number of other WordPress projects, including [ShrimpTest][4] (A/B testing for WordPress, with Automattic), and have contributed to the WordPress Core. I was also a core developer for the experimental natural language interface [Mozilla Ubiquity][5] and the [Tab Groups][6] feature in Firefox.

Notable previous clients and employers include [Automattic][7], [Mozilla][8], [Gameloft][9], [MIT][10], [the University of Chicago][11], [Vlingo][12] (now part of Nuance), and [JDRF][13].
